What the School Says...
There is no typical Smith student. Every incoming class includes students who have unusual talents and maybe some weaknesses. Though diverse, all have strong academic records, as well as several attributes that the board of admission seeks: motivation, determination, and curiosity. We admit students on the basis of a thorough, holistic review of each applicant's file. Smith offers three admission plans for first-year applicants:  Early Decision I, Early Decision II, and Regular Decision. Our early decision plans are binding. SAT or ACT scores are optional for U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents. The SAT or ACT is required for international students being instructed in English. The TOEFL or IELTS is required for students instructed in a language other than English. SAT II subject tests are  optional for all applicants.
What the School Says...
Smith College is committed to providing an outstanding education to qualified women from all economic backgrounds.  We meet the full documented need, as calculated by the college, of every admitted student who completes the financial aid application by the published deadlines.  We also offer financial advice to help families manage the cost of college, whether or not they qualify for aid.  Applicants for financial aid must submit the Smith Aid Application (available on Smith's website), the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), the College Scholarship Service (CSS) Profile, and a copy of the current federal income tax return.  Each financial aid application is given a personal review by our office of Student Financial Services.

If you are interested in doing research, Smith is the place for you.  Almost 80 percent of our students engage in significant and original research with faculty.

You will live in one of 35 houses, many of them Victorian-era private homes that have been renovated and adapted for contemporary college life. Each house is home to between 12 and 100 women.  There are 15 dining rooms that offer different menus, themes, and types of food, and no matter which house you live in, you may choose to eat wherever you wish.
