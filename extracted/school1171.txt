What the School Says...
Founded in 1787, Franklin & Marshall College is a residential liberal arts college of approximately 2,300 students. Our 182-acre campus is in the northwest corner of historic Lancaster, Penn., a city rich in the cultural arts and home to 55,000 residents.
What the School Says...
At F, there's no one way to describe our students. For every student daring enough to challenge the theory of relativity, there is another who seeks to find out how it applies to his or her daily life. For every science whiz there is a whiz with metaphors, a philosophy buff, or the next business entrepreneur. And for every student who has a passion for learning, there is a professor waiting to encourage that passion.
What the School Says...
F is committed to accessibility. We pledge to meet 100 percent of your financial need for all four years on campus. We provide more than $32 million per year in need-based grants and scholarships, and half of our students receive some type of need-based aid.
What the School Says...
The hallmarks of an F education are individual attention and support. Our faculty members challenge you to achieve your personal best. Our student-faculty ratio is 10:1, and two-thirds of our students collaborate on a research project with a faculty member.
What the School Says...
No one gets lost at F The depth and breadth of student activities and experiences provide everyone with a place to belong. Our students find "homes" in any of 100-plus clubs, athletic teams, performance groups, volunteer organizations, or Greek associations. We don't have dormitories. Our five College Houses are student-governed spaces that group first-year students into smaller cohorts. Houses are spaces to socialize, learn, and stretch your intellect. Based in every House are a faculty mentor (don) and an administrative counselor (prefect).
What the School Says...
F isn't a four-year experience. It's a family where you are always welcome, and it's a resource for lifelong learning. Our faculty and administrators will work with you at every stage of life to help you maximize your liberal arts education.
