What the School Says...
At Hartwick College, what you learn will take you everywhere. It's part of a journey. And it's an adventure, one that is sometimes messy but never, ever boring. We ask you to look up from a textbook as often as you look inside one. We ask you to take things apart. Put them back together. Pose a thousand questions. Get dirt under your nails digging up answers. Experiment. Fail. Try again. Nail it. Our 425-acre campus is located in Oneonta, N.Y., 75 miles from Albany.
What the School Says...
Hartwick admits freshman and transfer applicants on a rolling basis. We encourage freshmen to apply as early as possible in the fall of their senior year. Transfer candidates must submit completed applications by August 1 for the fall term and January 1 for the spring term. SAT and ACT scores are optional. You can decide whether you want us to look at your test scores when we consider you for admission and academic scholarships. Note that there are two exceptions to this policy: Freshman nursing applicants and home-schooled students must submit SAT or ACT scores.
What the School Says...
We want to make the Hartwick experience affordable for every qualified student. Last year, we awarded more than $21 million in merit- and need-based financial aid from Hartwick College funds. On average, Hartwick students received more than $15,000 each in college funds. Eligible students can also apply for substantial additional funds through federal and state aid.
What the School Says...
Your Hartwick education will include all of the liberal arts. Knowledge for knowledge's sake isn't our goal; learning to learn is. By working in a range of disciplines, you'll gain new perspectives, see hidden connections, and discover unexpected inspiration. You'll become a truly critical thinker and, more important, someone who contributes to the world of ideas and the world at large.
What the School Says...
Eighty percent of our students live on campus. During your first year at Hartwick, you'll live in one of our seven residence halls or at Pine Lake. You can live in an all-female residence at Van Ess Hall, alongside honors students in Holmes Hall, on a single-gender floor in the co-ed Smith Hall, or in Oyaron House, which is dedicated to substance-free living.
What the School Says...
Hartwick students come from a wide variety of states and countries and from various ethnic, religious, and socioeconomic backgrounds. As you live and work side-by-side with our diverse student population, you will grow together and share common experiences and goals. Our small campus makes friendships easy to cultivate and involvement readily available. And our students are incredibly successful after graduation. According to payscale.com, Hartwick ranks 50th in the nation among liberal arts colleges for average starting salary ($42,600). Ninety-three percent of our prelaw students are admitted to law school, and our premed students are admitted to medical schools at twice the national average.
