What the School Says...
At Skidmore College, we believe wholeheartedly that creative thought matters. Founded in 1903, Skidmore is a private, liberal arts college dedicated to putting academic theory and creative expression into practice. We're known for our interdisciplinary approach to learning, collaborative student-faculty research, off-campus study program (students can chose from 140 study-abroad programs and 60 percent of them travel abroad), and the prominence of the performing and visual arts throughout the campus and curriculum. Skidmore offers nearly 50 majors in the sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities, as well as in career-specific fields such as management and business, social work, education, and exercise science. Our beautiful 890-acre campus is located in vibrant Saratoga Springs, N.Y., a great place to spend four years. The downtown is brimming with galleries, shops, coffeehouses, clubs, and great restaurants, and the Adirondacks, Berkshires, and Green Mountains are all in easy striking distance. 
What the School Says...
Do you believe that creative thought matters? To your undergraduate experience, to the major you choose, to the life paths you will take? If the answer is yes, apply to Skidmore. We look first at the strength of your academic record: the quality of your high school courses, your achievement in those courses, your recommendations, and your standardized test scores. We seek students with strong academic ability, intellectual curiosity, creativity, open-mindedness, a commitment to learning, and a desire to contribute to a community committed to intellectual and personal integrity and citizenship.
What the School Says...
A private college education involves a considerable financial commitment. While students and their families assume primary responsibility for their educational costs, the Financial Aid Office works closely with students and their parents to develop financial aid packages and financing plans. Nearly half of Skidmore's students receive some form of financial aid. Most of the financial assistance at Skidmore is awarded on the basis of demonstrated need and is provided through a student-aid "package" that usually includes a grant, a campus job, and a loan. Student aid funds come from a variety of sources, including Skidmore's own need-based grants and scholarships, as well as federal, state, and independent programs.
What the School Says...
Choose from 50 areas of study including traditional liberal arts disciplines and pre-professional fields like management and business or health and exercise sciences. If you're like most students, you'll carry two majors or at least add a minor, and probably study abroad. Skidmore's First-Year Experience, which features 50 seminars on a wide range of topics, faculty and peer mentors, and campus housing in close proximity to seminar-mates, is an important kick-start to each student's life at Skidmore. It's all meant to ensure that you hit the ground running and are connected and involved from day one.
What the School Says...
There's no Greek life at Skidmore, and our students think it's great that frats and sororities don't get in the way. Instead, you can choose from 19 varsity sports and nearly 100 inclusive student clubs and organizations, ranging from the Model European Union to the Pre-med Club to the Environmental Action Club to SkidTV to snowboarding to anything you want to start up. It's a way to add value to academics and develop your leadership skills. It's fun and gets you engaged with the community. Most important, it can open doors to your professional future. 
What the School Says...
Skidmore students are creative and involved in and out of the classroom. Many carry two majors or at least add a minor, and 60 percent study abroad. They are a diverse student body from 50 countries and all 50 states. They are liberally educated graduates who continue their quest for knowledge and know how to make the choices required of informed, responsible citizens.
