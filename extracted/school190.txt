What the School Says...
Washington & Jefferson is a private liberal arts and sciences college located 30 miles south of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Our dedicated, experienced professors are passionate about teaching and work closely with our students to ensure that they receive a quality, comprehensive education. Our entire community is focused on student success. For more than 200 years, our alumni have been influencing change in business, politics, the arts and sciences as CEOs, lawyers, state representatives, doctors, researchers, writers and teachers, and in many other equally worthy professions. 
What the School Says...
Academic success at Washington & Jefferson is driven by engagement with distinguished faculty, involvement in the classroom, diligent study habits, and a strong desire to excel. Washington & Jefferson College no longer requires applicants to submit standardized test scores as a part of the admission process. Primary emphasis is placed upon the academic record and class rank, followed by standardized test scores, extracurricular activities, and personal statement. Applicants choosing the score-optional policy may be required to have an admission interview with a member of the admission staff, either on campus or by phone, and will be given full consideration, with no disadvantage for admission. 
What the School Says...
We strive to make a W education an affordable investment for all students.  Our average financial aid package is typically around $30,000, and we consider every accepted student for a merit scholarship ranging from $11,000 to $21,000 at the time of admission.
What the School Says...
As one of the nation's top-ranked liberal arts colleges, Washington & Jefferson offers a rigorous and rewarding curriculum, characterized by small classes taught by full-time professors. Our student-to-faculty ratio of 10:1 enables our professors to function as mentors who will know your name on the first day of class and cheer loudly when it is called at graduation. Our pre-law and pre-health programs are internationally recognized, our Magellan Project allows students to travel the world exploring their research interests, and more than 90 percent of our students graduate within four years.
What the School Says...
W students thrive both inside and outside of the classroom. Our vibrant residence life program is uniquely student-centered, with three of our twelve residence halls designed as themed communities centered around common intellectual, social or political ideologies that are chosen by the students themselves. A current sampling includes Pet House, where residents are allowed to own and care for animals, and Green House, where residents practice sustainable living.
We also offer more than 80 student clubs and organizations. With options like Young Entrepreneurs Society, Film Club and Big Brothers/Big Sisters (just to a name a few), Presidents have no shortage of opportunities for campus involvement and community service.
What the School Says...
At W, we are committed to student success. Toward that end, we will work with you in personalized, one-on-one advising sessions and in challenging, small classes to help you discover your talents, nurture them, and excel. We have a committed staff of career counseling experts, as well as a strong alumni network whose members have influenced change in business, politics, science, and the arts for  more than 200 years. Finally, we know that on-time graduation is essential; it makes your education affordable and provides important career momentum.  The W On-Time Graduation Guarantee promises that all students who meet the College's academic expectations will be able to graduate in four years.
