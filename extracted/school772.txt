What the School Says...
Seattle University puts you in the center of one of the country's most dynamic cities. Internship, volunteer, and research opportunities abound; and the city's music, art, and cultural resources provide a lot of social offerings for students.
What the School Says...
The application process is your chance to tell us all about you. Building a diverse and cohesive student community means looking at more than just the numbers. We're interested in the whole person. We'll review your application individually to learn all the ways you have taken advantage of your academic and extracurricular opportunities. We employ an applicant's highest subscores on both the ACT and SAT when making decisions about admissions, scholarships, and course placement of first-time freshmen.
What the School Says...
What may surprise you is how affordable a Seattle University education can be. As a private university, we can provide students who might not otherwise be able to afford college with access to a quality education. Nearly 90 percent of students receive financial aid. Generous scholarships are also available to recognize and support strong academic and extracurricular achievement, regardless of financial need.
What the School Says...
Our approach to Jesuit education incorporates personal reflection, rigorous and wide-ranging study, global awareness, and a commitment to service. It's a holistic education involving mind, body, and spirit, the big picture, and your place in it. Our class sizes are small (typically no more than 25 students) and our faculty-to-student ratio of 1:13 ensures that students have plenty of interaction with leading scholars and with each other.
What the School Says...
Cheering on the Redhawks, improvisational theater, and film production are just some of the activities that more than 130 clubs make available at SU. Clubs for community service, cultural heritage, professional development, and recreation underlie a tight-knit campus. Our campus is a model for modern, sustainable building. Lemieux Library is a popular gathering spot for students and combines state-of-the-art technology with extensive academic support and research services.
What the School Says...
Three out of four SU students engage in community service by the time they graduate. A commitment to making a difference is central to our mission of empowering leaders for a just and humane world. Our students are interested in the education of the whole person, awareness of different cultures, social justice, and the fulfillment that comes from making a difference in the world.
