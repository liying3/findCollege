What the School Says...
Founded in 1865 in Worcester, Mass., 45 miles west of Boston, WPI was one of the nation's earliest technological universities. From our founding days, we've taken a unique approach to science and technology education. Our curriculum is both innovative and practical. Small classes, a flexible, hands-on curriculum, and one-on-one interaction with top-notch professors make learning at WPI an experience unlike any other. Students complete projects on campus and around the globe. They connect what they have learned in the classroom with pressing real-life challenges from human health and the environment to business and engineering.
What the School Says...
WPI offers two rounds of nonbinding early action admissions, with deadlines of November 10 and January 1. The regular admission deadline is February 1. Transfer students should apply by April 15 for priority consideration. Students may submit SAT or ACT scores and alternative materials through WPI's Flex Path. Students who choose the Flex Path are encouraged to submit examples of academic work or extracurricular projects that reflect a high level of organization, motivation, creativity, and problem-solving ability. International students whose first language is not English must submit TOEFL or IELTS exam scores.
What the School Says...
WPI offers both need- and merit-based financial aid. We offer academic scholarships to freshman applicants based upon their academic performance, leadership, extracurricular involvement, and community service. We consider all admitted applicants for merit-based aid; no separate application is required. However, students applying for need-based aid must submit a FAFSA and CSS Profile application by the February 1 priority deadline.
What the School Says...
We believe that students should understand how to apply knowledge and how to function effectively in a global environment, not just how to cite facts and theories. More than 40 percent of our undergraduates spend time abroad, and our graduates emerge ready to take on some of the most difficult challenges in science and technology. WPI offers more than 35 areas of study within engineering, science, management, and the liberal arts. Exciting new interdisciplinary programs are driven by real-world demand, such as interactive media and game development, robotics engineering, and environmental engineering. If you're undecided, you're not alone. Over 40 percent of students change their major at least once, and approximately 35 percent of students graduate with at least one minor.
What the School Says...
The WPI community is alive with activity. Students may choose to participate in any of our nearly 200 activities, including 12 fraternities and 3 sororities, 16 musical and theatrical groups, 20 cultural and religious organizations, 12 community service groups, and intramural sports. There are also fun campus-wide events, including Homecoming, Winter Ball, and QuadFest. Over 95 percent of first-year students live on campus in one of our six residence halls, five residence houses, or two apartment complexes. 
What the School Says...
Our more than 3,000 undergraduates hail from across the nation and around the world. While students pursue academic programs in the sciences, engineering, business management, and the liberal arts, they also pursue diverse extracurricular interests such as water polo, motor sports, and ballroom dancing.
