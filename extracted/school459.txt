What the School Says...
Founded in 1860, Augustana is a private, selective liberal arts college affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Augustana enrolls 2,500 students of diverse social and cultural backgrounds. Located on a wooded, hilly, 115-acre campus within Rock Island, Illinois, Augustana is the only undergraduate college of the liberal arts and sciences in the Quad Cities, a metropolitan community of 400,000 on the banks of the Mississippi River, 165 miles west of Chicago. The Quad Cities offers something for every student's interests: internships in global corporations, local businesses, and not-for-profits; recreational and cultural opportunities including the arts, sports, and annual festivals; and social outreach. 
What the School Says...
Augustana College wants to get to know you and hear your story.  When considering your application, we will look at key areas including the breadth and rigor of your high school curriculum, standardized test scores, letters of recommendation, a writing sample, co-curricular activities, and demonstrated interest. Augustana currently accepts scores from either the ACT or SAT. If you have taken a test multiple times, we will consider your highest composite score. The middle 50 percent of Augustana students score between a 24 and 29 on the ACT. However, if you feel your grades and overall performance in the classroom are better indicators of your academic ability than your ACT or SAT score, we encourage you to look into our test-optional admissions process.
What the School Says...
Ninety-six percent of students receive financial assistance. More than $39 million is awarded annually from various sources, including Augustana scholarships. Students awarded scholarships and financial aid may receive $5,500 - $45,000, depending on many factors.
What the School Says...
Augustana boasts nearly 90 majors and related areas of study in the arts, sciences, and pre-professional fields leading to the Bachelor of Arts. The selective Honors Program offers the choice of one of two tracks: Foundations, a humanities-based program, or Logos, a science-based program. Distinguishing features of the academic program include the Senior Inquiry, a capstone project in collaboration with a faculty mentor in his or her field, and Augie Choice, a program that offers $2,000 to each student to support internships, research with a professor, or study abroad. The classroom environment is close and collaborative, with a student to faculty ratio of 12:1 and average class size of 22.  All classes are taught by faculty, not graduate teaching assistants.
What the School Says...
Augustana College's 12 men's and 11 women's varsity teams compete in the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin (CCIW) and NCAA Division III. The college also offers many club and intramural sports, recreational programs, and more than 100 extra-curricular clubs and organizations in part because these experiences find practical outlets and a welcoming environment in the Quad Cities. The diversity of the Quad Cities offers something for every student's talents and interests: from internships in global corporations, local businesses, and not-for profits, to an astounding array of social opportunities and cultural experiences, including the arts, athletics, ethnic festivals, and social outreach.
What the School Says...
The roughly 2,500 students who attend Augustana College come from diverse social, ethnic, religious, cultural, and geographic backgrounds. They represent more than two-thirds of the United States and about 20 countries. More than eighty-five percent of first-year students continue to the sophomore year; 94 percent of graduating students have been in college only four years. More than 50 percent of students are involved in sports, and 85 percent of students volunteer.
