What the School Says...
The University of Iowa is consistently recognized as one of the top public universities in the country. Located in the heart of a classic college town, Iowa offers highly ranked academic programs, student organizations for nearly every interest, research opportunities for undergraduates, a premier career development center, and a wide variety of cultural and athletic events.
What the School Says...
Application deadlines at the University of Iowa vary depending on what you plan to study and whether you are a first-year, transfer, or international applicant. For most programs, April 1 is the deadline to apply for summer or fall admission; November 15 is the deadline to apply for spring semester admission. Students applying for summer or fall have until May 1 to accept admission. Students may earn up to 30 hours of credit toward an Iowa undergraduate degree through the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) or the Advanced Placement (AP) program.
What the School Says...
Based on our academic programs, cost, and student life, the University of Iowa is one of only 20 public universities in the U.S., Canada, and U.K. listed as a "Best Buy" in the 2013 Fiske Guide to Colleges. Our tuition and fees are among the lowest in the Big Ten. The Office of Student Financial Aid oversees hundreds of opportunities for scholarships, grants, loans, and student employment.
What the School Says...
Iowa offers more than 100 areas of study for undergraduates. The most popular majors for first-year students are business, engineering, pre-medicine, psychology, pre-nursing, biology, pre-pharmacy, and English. About 18 percent of students are enrolled as "open" or undecided majors. The Academic Advising Center offers programs to help undecided students research majors and career opportunities.
What the School Says...
Iowa has one of the most dynamic college campuses in the country, with nearly 500 student groups. More than 90 percent of freshmen choose to live on-campus in our ten residence halls, which include more than 20 Living-Learning Communities based on majors or interests. Iowa has 30 sororities and fraternities, including Latino and African American chapters.
What the School Says...
Student success is our highest priority, and we aspire to be known for the most student-centered experience in the Big Ten. What's special about the high-quality education at Iowa is that we provide a small college experience in a large university setting. We create a sense of community among our students through small First-Year Seminars with our most talented professors, specialized Living-Learning Communities in our residence halls, and other programs. As a research university, we also offer students unique opportunities to directly assist professors who are working on cutting-edge discoveries. In addition to the wealth of extra- and co-curricular activities on our campus, from athletics to the arts to community service, students can develop their leadership skills through such programs as the President's Leadership Class and the Career Leadership Academy.
