What the School Says...
 Imagine a community of nearly 7,000 students that draws bright minds and big ideas from around the world to come explore with one another. A university where classrooms can extend seamlessly into oceans, mountains, rainforests and volcanic craters or deep into new or ancient cultures halfway across the globe. Imagine an educational experience made up of amazing adventures, as many as the mind can imagine, as far as the eye can see. This is Hawai'i Pacific University (HPU).
With students from all 50 U.S. states and nearly 80 countries, HPU prides itself on maintaining strong academic programs, small class sizes, individual attention to students, and a diverse faculty and student population. 
What the School Says...
HPU knows that each student has a unique academic history and individual talents.  This is why HPU takes a holistic approach in reviewing applications, and considers all the information provided on your application to make an admission decision.
Applications are accepted on a rolling basis year-round, but it is recommended that students apply at least 2 to 5 months prior to the start of the term they are interested in. Once your application is complete, it usually takes two weeks to receive an admissions decision, depending upon the time of year. 
What the School Says...
HPU students graduate with less debt, and they are also more likely to end up with higher salaries, according to the "Best Western U.S. Colleges by Salary Potential" report from Payscale. In fact, HPU graduates receive the highest starting salary among graduates from all other universities in the state of Hawai'i, and HPU ranks best in Hawai'i for college return on investment by PayScale's 2014 report.
The average debt of an HPU graduate is a fraction of what others typically incur nationally. So, it's no surprise that HPU is rated a "Best Buy" in college education by Barron's business magazine, and Bloomberg Businessweek consistently recognizes HPU as the "Best Undergraduate Return on Investment" of any private college or university in the state of Hawai'i.
What the School Says...
HPU is a well-rounded academic institution with more than 50 undergraduate degree programs and 14 graduate programs. Academic strengths range from international business to marine science to diplomacy and military studies. HPU boasts nearly 500 full-time and part-time faculty members with outstanding academic and business credentials. Faculty range from top-level executives at Fortune 500 companies to state government leaders who enliven the learning experience with real-world knowledge. HPU's student-centered approach and low student-faculty ratio of 15:1 naturally results in personal attention and one-on-one guidance. Even with nearly 7,000 students, the average class size is less than 20 students.
However, rest assured that your intellectual adventures will take you far beyond the classroom. You'll have plenty of opportunities to get your hands dirty as you learn, discover and explore at a university like no other. 
What the School Says...
A big part of your college experience is what happens outside the classroom. The island of Oahu is known for its year-round tropical weather, perfect for all sorts of outdoor activities. Learn to surf or paddle board on Waikiki Beach, hike to pristine waterfalls, swim with turtles in Hanauma Bay, and watch world-renowned surfing competitions on the North Shore to name a few. You can also explore Fort Street Mall where friends, special events, live music, and local artists come together near our downtown campus. 
On campus, there are lots of activities and events to participate in. Join or lead one of more than 50 student clubs and organizations or compete in NCAA Division II athletic sports. HPU's athletic teams have won numerous national championship titles. Men's teams include baseball, basketball, cross-country, golf, soccer and tennis. Women's teams include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis, golf, volleyball, and acrobatics and tumbling. 
Students also participate in Holoholo Oahu (cruise Oahu), an exciting program that allows students to explore the beautiful and unique island of Oahu, Hawaii. In addition, HPU is building new urban, waterfront lofts amidst retail shops and restaurants at Aloha Tower in downtown Honolulu for students to enjoy. 
What the School Says...
 There's no limit to where you can go with an HPU education. Our graduates work for top employers from around the world, such as Merrill Lynch, Apple, and the CIA. In 2013, our students landed top internships and fellowships with Congress, the U.S. State Department, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, while others pursued internships in Australia, China, Japan and well beyond. Many of our students go on to pursue graduate or doctoral degrees at prestigious institutions. And, before they graduate, nearly 50 percent of our graduates have jobs with companies throughout the world.
