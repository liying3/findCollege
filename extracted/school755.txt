What the School Says...
Founded in 1876, the University of Oregon is the state's flagship public university. The UO's commitment to academic excellence and groundbreaking research, coupled with the beauty of Oregon and a welcoming campus community, attracts top-notch students and faculty. Located in the classic college town of Eugene and nestled between the Pacific Ocean and the Cascade Mountain Range, the UO is environmentally conscious, socially active, and alive with opportunities for outdoor recreation. 
What the School Says...
When making an admission decision, the UO considers the following criteria: strength of academic coursework, grades earned, grade trend, class rank, standardized test scores, senior-year course load, motivation as demonstrated in the application essay, extracurricular activities including community service and the need to work to assist your family, ability to enhance the diversity of the university, academic potential, and special talents. We require all freshman applicants to submit scores from either the SAT or ACT (with optional writing components), but we do not require a minimum score on these exams unless the applicant's GPA is below 3.0. 
What the School Says...
We make a concerted effort to enable you to attend Oregon regardless of your family's income. If you seek financial aid, file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and list the UO as one of your first choices. To meet the UO's March 1 priority deadline for financial aid, submit the FAFSA as soon as possible after January 1. Visit our website to learn more about our scholarship programs and other financial aid resources.

The UO's Clark Honors College is one of the nation's oldest honor's colleges.

The Oregon Duck, with its historic ties to Donald and penchant for push-ups, is one of the nation's most beloved mascots and a fixture at athletic events from track and field to football.
