What the School Says...
As a founding member of the State University of New York System, SUNY Oneonta is a multifaceted liberal arts college with a strong pre-professional focus.  Small classes, opportunities for undergraduate research, and student-faculty interaction are all offered to students for an exceptional value.  Curriculum rooted in scholarship prepares students for successful careers and the pursuit of advanced degrees. The SUNY Oneonta campus overlooks the scenic Susquehanna River Valley in central New York about halfway between Albany and Binghamton.  The college is located on the outskirts of the city of Oneonta.  Residents and visitors enjoy the area's natural beauty, outdoor recreational opportunities and many historic sites.  At SUNY Oneonta you will find faculty members dedicated to student success, state-of-the-art facilities and amenities, challenging academic programs and a diverse student body.
What the School Says...
SUNY Oneonta is a highly selective college.  We strive to enroll a student body that is academically well-qualified and culturally diverse. For freshmen applicants, we've found that the best measure of academic potential is past achievement. We look at your high school grades and the courses you've taken. We also consider your class rank, trends in your grades, your senior-year course load, your Regents grades (for New York state applicants), and your standardized test scores. Applicants must be graduates of an accredited secondary school or have evidence of equivalent education.  Transfer applicants are reviewed on a variety of criteria including a competitive and challenging academic program with courses relating to your intended major and high quality academic performance. Letters of recommendation, activity lists, and essays are also considered as part of the application process.
What the School Says...
SUNY Oneonta provides an exceptional education at an affordable cost. We have been frequently recognized by national organizations for our academic quality and commitment to student engagement. We recognize that paying for college can be a challenge for many families, and the staff in our Financial Aid Office works hard to connect students with resources that can help.  Eighty percent of SUNY Oneonta students receive some form of financial assistance, and we awarded over $2 million in scholarships last year.
What the School Says...
With a wide range of curriculum offerings in five different schools, SUNY Oneonta appeals to students who have already found their niche,  as well as those who are ready to discover it.  To understand how deeply we care about academics, look no further than the college's mission statement. It's just one sentence long, but it speaks volumes: SUNY Oneonta unites excellence in teaching, scholarship, civic engagement, and stewardship to create a student-centered learning community.
Students who are looking for a liberal arts education that will prepare them to be competitive for graduate study or employment will find a wide variety of options among our 70 majors and nationally accredited programs. Our determination to provide a stimulating, rigorous environment and hands-on, high-impact learning has made Oneonta a premier school within the SUNY system. This is also why we tend to attract students and teachers who want small classes, undergraduate research opportunities, and plenty of student-faculty interaction.
What the School Says...
You should make memories that last a lifetime in college. We are dedicated to this idea, not in spite of our scholarly mission, but as a complement to it. Boredom and learning simply are not compatible. This may be our strongest argument for the nearly 100 clubs and organizations on our campus, for the hundreds of hours of entertainment, countless athletic events and social programming that go on every semester, and for giving our Student Association, created "by the students and to serve the students," an annual budget of over $1 million. Our welcoming residential community is here to ensure that students are given what they need to succeed.  We provide students with an environment conducive to healthy living and learning, a sense of safety and security within the student community, and the chance to learn life skills to complement their academic progress and assist them in becoming well-balanced individuals.
What the School Says...
We focus, day in and day out, on providing our students with outstanding living and learning opportunities. Our curriculum is flexible, diverse, and challenging, with resources to match all kinds of interests. We're committed outside of the classroom to offering a wide range of options for socializing, entertainment, and engagement.  Students logged over 50,000 hours of community service last year and are committed to giving back to the campus and greater Oneonta community.  Over 140 students completed a research project and participated in our 2013 Student Research and Creative Activity day.  With opportunities to study abroad, intern locally at a place like our Biological Field Station or at a large corporation in New York City, host a show on the campus radio station, or have artwork displayed in one of two art galleries, the chances to let yourself shine are endless. Offices like New Student Services, the Career Development Center, Academic Advisement, Athletics and Recreation, Educational Opportunity Program, Student Disability Services, Office of Multicultural Student Affairs, Center for Multicultural Experiences, Residential and Community Life, Gender and Sexuality Resource Center, and the Counseling, Health and Wellness Center are all here to assist you in having a successful college career.
