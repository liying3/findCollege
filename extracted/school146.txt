What the School Says...
Located in the heart of Boston, BU is a private research university ranked in the top four percent of universities in the country. Its 1.3-mile residential campus is home to more than 250 programs of study in nine undergraduate schools and colleges. Living in one of the most culturally diverse cities in the world, BU students can catch a fly ball at Fenway Park, visit world-class museums or Chinatown, or earn an impressive internship with just one of Boston's many industry-leading companies or medical centers. 
What the School Says...
Admission to BU is very competitive. We're looking for achievers who will succeed academically and thrive among students with a wide variety of interests, talents, and goals. Your high school performance is our best indicator of how you'll do at BU. We look at a variety of factors, including overall level of achievement; enrollment in honors, AP- or IB-level courses; and your individual academic strengths. The most competitive students are those who enrolled and excelled in the most challenging courses available to them. Because we are looking for students who will create a unique, diverse community, we also consider extracurricular activities and interests, special talents and skills, and recommendations.
What the School Says...
Attending BU, like most prestigious colleges and universities, takes an investment. But we invest in you too, by making merit awards and need-based financial aid available. Last year, BU awarded nearly $50 million in aid to incoming freshmen. Those with need-based grants had 90 percent of their calculated financial eligibility met. We award need-based grants based on a combination of calculated financial eligibility and academic merit. Scholarships are also offered to academically talented candidates with minimal or no financial eligibility, but whose calculated family contributions do not substantially exceed the cost of attending BU. While we make every effort to help students in need, we do not have sufficient funds to assist all eligible applicants. Students with the strongest academic records receive priority consideration for available funds. 
What the School Says...
Academic programs are rigorous and offer a unique global perspective, such as the occupational therapy program (ranked No. 2 in the country), the seven-year accelerated dental and medicine program, or the top-ranked biomedical engineering program. Get ready to be challenged! Classes are taught by award-winning faculty, such as Nobel Prize winners and a Poet Laureate, with a student-teacher ratio of just 13:1. Professors provide opportunities for undergraduates to participate in cutting-edge research in areas such as engineering and psychology. They're here to engage, challenge, and inspire you on a daily basisand they want you to do the same for them.  
What the School Says...
BU is a tight-knit, residential campus and a multicultural community. With nearly 500 student organizations to get involved in, there's always a way to make new friends and explore Boston. There are 24 NCAA Division I varsity sports at BU, including the men's hockey team (29-time Beanpot Champions!). Students can also work up a sweat through more than 40 intramural club sports or at our state-of-the-art Fitness and Recreation Center. To ensure that freshmen get the most out of their BU experience, we require them to live on campus their first year and guarantee housing on campus for four years. The range of housing options includes modern high-rises, 19th-century brownstones, dormitories and apartments, six-person suites, and private singles.
What the School Says...
BU students come from all 50 U.S. states, more than 100 countries, and a myriad of ethnic, cultural, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Twenty different languages are spoken here in a hundred different dialects. But each student shares some similar traits: they're all bright, driven, and inquisitive. They are "do-ers" who are not afraid to jump in and go for itwhether conducting research in a lab with a professor, working for the student newspaper, or studying "where it all began" in the Galpagos with their classmates.
Through academic counseling and career guidance services, BU makes sure students get the support, encouragement, and advice they need. Our new Center for Student Services is home to the Center for Career Development, the Educational Resource Center, the Arts & Sciences Writing Program, the Pre-Professional Advising Office, and the Student Academic Life Office.
