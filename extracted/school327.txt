What the School Says...
A private university chartered in 1890, the University of Chicago has a long-standing reputation as one of the world's great intellectual communities, and for placing undergraduates at the center of it. UChicago's Core curriculum, one of the nation's oldest, is almost alone in offering undergraduates a systematic study of the arts and sciences in partnership with a liberal arts faculty of more than 1,000. The campus is located seven miles south of downtown Chicago in the neighborhood of Hyde Park.
What the School Says...
UChicago offers first-year applicants two plans: Early Action (deadline November 1) and Regular Notification (deadline January 2). Our Early Action program is non-binding, and confers no advantage on applicants. All admitted students have until May 1 to reply to their offer of admission. The University of Chicago requires either an SAT Reasoning Test or ACT score as part of the application. The writing section of the ACT is not required, and the writing section of the SAT is not considered. Students are not required to submit Subject Test scores. Limited credit is offered for AP and IB exams.
What the School Says...
UChicago's admissions process is need-blind for domestic students, permanent residents, and citizens of Canada. We do consider need as we review international students, and applying for financial aid places them in an extremely competitive pool. However, we meet 100 percent of demonstrated need for all admitted students. Most need is met with grant money, although student loans and work-study may also be utilized.
What the School Says...
UChicago offers more than 50 areas of specialized study, complementing the breadth of the Core curriculum with an opportunity to delve into a particular area.  A major may provide a comprehensive understanding of a well-defined field, such as anthropology or mathematics, or it may be an interdisciplinary program such as Big Problems or Biological Chemistry.  Students can choose an interdisciplinary program, such as cinema and media studies or law, letters, and society, or to study comprehensively a well-defined field such as biology or economics. Students are admitted to the general college, without consideration of their intended major, and typically declare a major after two years of study.
What the School Says...
UChicago's ten residence halls are divided into Houses, which are communities made up of 60-70 students who share a common space, a dining hall, a House Council, and a Resident Assistant and Resident Head (an advanced graduate student or faculty member). These communities act as home base, while more than 400 student organizations enrich the eclectic and urban social life students enjoy on campus and in its Hyde Park neighborhood.
What the School Says...
UChicago is an institution that demonstrates that knowledge itself can enrich our lives. We offer a community where students thrive and ideas matter. Through small classes and interdisciplinary collaboration, students discover that their fellow classmates' enthusiasm and love of learning is invaluable to a successful education. Our hundreds of clubs and organizations testify to the diverse (and oftentimes divergent) interests of our students. Students pursue their passions (academic and otherwise) within a compelling environment of support.
