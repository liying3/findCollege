What the School Says...
Oberlin has been at the forefront of social change since the 1830s. We were the first college in America with a policy to admit students of color and the first to grant bachelor's degrees to women in a co-educational program. Inclusion and social engagement remain core values at Oberlin today. We are a community of thinkers, scholars, artists, musicians, and activists who share an intense desire for learning, creation, and engagement. We care about the world, believe we can make it a better place, and have the courage to try. 
What the School Says...
A strong high school performance in a full range of challenging classes is essential. We also look for what you are like as a person, and what you will contribute to the Oberlin community. We seek an incoming class that represents a variety of talents, viewpoints, and achievements, and we employ a rigorous and holistic review process to ensure that each application receives careful consideration.
What the School Says...
Oberlin's financial aid policy is simple: We meet the full demonstrated financial need of every admitted student through a combination of grants, loans, and money earned through student employment. About three-quarters of Oberlin students receive some form of need-based financial assistance each year. Our three-part award package typically includes grants from the college, low-interest student loans, and work-study jobs. We commit more than $57 million annually in institutional grant aid to students. This makes Oberlin affordable to many talented students who otherwise might not be able to pursue an Oberlin education. All applicants are also automatically considered for merit-based scholarships.
What the School Says...
We are a highly selective college with rigorous classes. More Oberlin alumni go on to earn Ph.D.s than do the graduates of any other liberal arts college in the nation. Yet Oberlin's learning environment is collaborative rather than competitive. Musical opportunities abound at Oberlin, whether you're earning a liberal arts degree, studying in our Conservatory of Music, or doing both through our Double Degree Program. But we're not just about the arts. Oberlin has long been recognized as a leader in educating undergraduate scientists, offering unparalleled access to faculty mentors and laboratory resources. A majority of science majors pursue research, either on campus or in the field.
What the School Says...
Our highly respected liberal arts college and world-renowned Conservatory of Music combine to create a learning environment like no other. Students in both divisions live, eat, and study together on a single campus. More than 80 percent of Oberlin students live on campus and most stay during weekends. Students usually belong to more than one (or two) student organizations, from athletic teams and dance troupes to groups formed around political causes and cultural affinities. Nearly a quarter of Oberlin students live or eat in a student-run co-op. Alternative options for housing and dining reflect our campus culture: involved, independent thinkers who want to change the world for the better. 
What the School Says...
Oberlin students prize creativity and self-expression while holding themselves to high standards of inquiry, debate, and achievement. They form close bonds through a shared commitment to pushing the limits of their determination, intellect, and creativity. Whether it's through music, theater, dance, politics, community service, or original research, they all contribute to Oberlin's vibrant learning environment.
