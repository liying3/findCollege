What the School Says...
Grand View University is a liberal arts university offering undergraduate and graduate education. Founded more than 100 years ago, Grand View offers an academically challenging, career-oriented, liberal arts-grounded curriculum to a diverse student body at two campus locations in greater Des Moines. Because of our ties to the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, we help students learn to think critically, informed by both faith and reason, and learn about God and themselves through a variety of ways of knowing.
What the School Says...
 As a Grand View student, you'll be immersed in studying and preparing for your future career, but you'll also have the opportunity to study abroad in such locations as Denmark, Brazil, France, and Italy. Learning about another culture, in another country, helps you appreciate the diversity of the world, and it may help you discover how very similar cultures actually are. It's also a lot of fun! Grand View has state-of-the-art computer and testing facilities as well as Wi-Fi on campus. Internet is provided in campus housing, and commuter students can use Wi-Fi hot spots or one of the many computer labs.
What the School Says...
We all know that college is expensive. That's why you want to pick a college that offers you an unprecedented value. In a recent National Survey of Student Engagement, Grand View outscored all its peers in the level of academic challenge offered. At Grand View, you get the best of two worlds: a quality private education and a modest price. That's value.
What the School Says...
Grand View offers a wide range of majors, so there's sure to be one that's right for you, whether it's graphic design, business, nursing, or education. We also have some unique majors, concentrations, and certificates, such as real estate, paralegal studies, and art therapy. Our individualized major allows you to craft your own course of study with the help of our faculty. At Grand View, students find a winning combination of high-quality programs, experienced professors, and caring individuals. With 2,200 students (more than 1,700 full-time), an average class size of 17, and a student-to-faculty ratio of 14 to 1, students get to know their professors and other students well. They learn independence and seek responsibility in Grand View's educational environment. Learning is an interactive process at Grand View. Students engage in lively discussions, work on real-world projects, and participate in career-related work experiences
What the School Says...
We understand that a sense of community and genuine, personal relationships are important for personal growth outside the classroom. The Residence Life organization  works with academic and other campus organizations to provide you with a holistic experience. We offer activities to complement academics as well as help you develop socially, emotionally, and physically.
What the School Says...
Grand View welcomes and supports students from all walks of life, geographies, religions, and ethnicities. There are approximately 30 states and 15 countries represented on campus. About 80 percent of students are from Iowa. Collectively we embrace our common humanity and live out our calling in community with others. Our campus ministry is open and inclusive, acknowledging and affirming a diversity of religious traditions, values, and expressions. Campus pastors and our student Campus Ministries coordinators support a variety of faith-based activities. All are welcome. Almost 100 percent of Grand View graduates seeking post-graduate opportunities are employed in their chosen field or are enrolled in graduate school within six months of graduation. How do we know?
