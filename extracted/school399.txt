What the School Says...
Founded in 1754, Columbia University occupies a 36-acre, self-contained, traditional campus located in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. Columbia enrolls approximately 4,500 undergraduates at Columbia College, 1,500 undergraduates at Columbia Engineering, and also encompasses more than a dozen graduate schools. Students come from over 90 foreign countries and choose among nearly 100 fields of study. Columbia provides access to all the resources of a world-class university as well as instant access to the world's financial, cultural, and communications capital: New York City.
What the School Says...
Columbia uses a holistic review process when evaluating applicants for admission; admission to Columbia is not based on a simple formula of grades and test scores. Instead, we consider a variety of factors: the student's academic record, extracurricular interests, intellectual achievements, and personal background. All first-year applicants must apply using the Common Application by November 1 for Early Decision admission or by January 1 for Regular Decision admission. We require the SAT and two SAT Subject Tests or the ACT with Writing. If submitting the SAT and applying to Columbia College, a candidate may take any two SAT Subject Tests; for Columbia Engineering, we require any mathematics test and Physics, Chemistry, or Biology. Students should not rush scores.
What the School Says...
We believe cost should not be a barrier to pursuing educational dreams, and we strive to make Columbia accessible to students from every socioeconomic background. For each admitted student, Columbia reviews a family's financial circumstances, determines financial need, and awards aid to meet all of that demonstrated financial need through grants and work-study. Loans are not a component of Columbia financial aid packages. Parents earning less than $60,000 a year (and with typical assets) contribute $0 towards their children's Columbia education. Parents earning between $60,000 and $100,000 (and with typical assets) have substantially lowered contribution requirements, and even parents earning over $100,000 still can qualify for significant financial aid from Columbia. We offer over $122 million in financial aid each year, and over half of our students receive some sort of financial assistance.
What the School Says...
About 100 undergraduate areas of study are offered at Columbia, in addition to a number of joint programs with other schools and colleges. These diverse areas of study are offered through Columbia's two traditional undergraduate divisions, Columbia College and Columbia Engineering. Even more opportunities exist with Columbia's many graduate and professional schools (in law, medicine, journalism, business, the arts, and more), as well as through joint programs with Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs, Law School, and the Juilliard School. The Core Curriculum, founded in 1919, is an evolving series of small, Socratic-style seminars in the liberal arts that all students take, regardless of their choice in major. The communal learning, with all students encountering the same texts at the same time, is the Core Curriculum's distinctive feature. 
What the School Says...
The Columbia campus is a park-like, self-contained, urban village located in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. First-year students are required to live on campus, and housing is guaranteed for all four years; about 95 percent of undergraduates live in campus housing for all four years. Columbia fields 31 Division I Ivy League athletic teams along with dozens of club and intramural sports, and more than 500 student organizations. Living in the largest and most diverse U.S. city, Columbians take advantage of countless research, internship, cultural, and academic opportunities in New York City. CU Arts provides free or low-cost tickets to Broadway shows, museums, dance performances, and concerts.
What the School Says...
An international student body does not refer merely to the number of countries, ethnicities, or cultures represented, but it describes the tenor and character of a place. At Columbia young men and women from all over the world engage with each other in serious dialogue between cultures, nations, races, and religions in an environment where the world's leading scholars moderate and shape conversation. Our students choose from nearly 100 programs of study as well as over 500 student organizations, thousands of internship opportunities, and over 200 study abroad programs around the world to enhance their Columbia experience.
