What the School Says...
We base our initial admissions decisions on a holistic assessment. In addition to GPA and performance on standardized tests, we consider the quality, quantity, and level of coursework students have taken during high school. We look especially for coursework completed beyond the minimum requirements, such as AP, IB, Oregon PASS, or college coursework. Strength of the high school program and class rank are considered within the context of the school attended. Also considered is the completion of a progressively challenging math sequence and 15 required subject area courses. Using your Insight Resume, we consider your accomplishments, perspectives, experiences, and talents; your achievements within the context of your social and personal circumstances; and your participation in activities that develop academic, intellectual, and leadership abilities.
What the School Says...
Financial aid at Oregon State is intended to supplement student and family contributions toward educational costs. We offer need-based and merit-based financial aid in the form of grants, scholarships, federal work study, subsidized and unsubsidized loans, and parent loans. Aid comes from many sources, including federal and state governments, private organizations, and Oregon State University's institutional funds. Oregon State uses the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to determine a student's financial need and eligibility for various programs. Financial aid awards are designed to meet as much of a student's financial need as possible, and are determined by the student's need level and availability of funds. 
What the School Says...
