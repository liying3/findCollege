What the School Says...
Emerson College is America's only comprehensive college or university dedicated exclusively to the study and advancement of communication and arts in a liberal arts context. It offers distinctive undergraduate and graduate programs that educate leaders and entrepreneurs in these fields. Since its beginning in 1880, Emerson has been a place for unique students whose thought and experience overlap: thinking is linked to doing. The campus is at the gateway of Boston's Theatre District and close to cultural centers, media outlets, and public transportation. It is home to approximately 3,400 full-time undergraduates in majors ranging from Communication Sciences and Disorders to Performing Arts to Writing, Literature, and Publishing. Emerson also offers study and internship programs in Los Angeles and Washington D.C; study abroad in the Netherlands, Taiwan, London, Beijing, and the Czech Republic; and course cross-registration with the six-member Boston Pro Arts Consortium. 
What the School Says...
Emerson accepts the Common Application and requires Emerson-specific questions and a writing sample. Admission is competitive, but the selection process takes into account more than grade point averages and standardized test scores. Emerson looks at writing competency, recommendations, and the quality of the courses taken, as well as any evidence of special accomplishments, contributions, extracurricular activities, leadership, and involvement. All first-year students are invited to apply to the Honors Program by submitting an additional essay.
What the School Says...
Attending Emerson is an investment,  one that is well worth the cost.  The College is a national leader for communication and the arts and boasts a multitalented faculty and accomplished student body.  We also have state-of-the-art facilities and equipment to support student work. Emerson's tuition is up to $10,000 less than our closest competitors.  We are committed to keeping the bottom line as low as we can for our students.  Emerson offers a wide variety of financial assistance programs including merit scholarships, need-based grants, loan programs, and work-study.
What the School Says...
At Emerson College, excellence in learning, scholarship, and creative work springs from the same source: integration of the liberal arts and the student's chosen academic discipline.  From the day you set foot on campus, you will find opportunities to get involved, practice what you'd like to learn, and collaborate with your classmates. Outside of class, the Emerson campus buzzes day and night with students actively engaged in the creative arts. Options include our award-winning, student-run radio station, television and film organizations, marketing and entrepreneurship programs, theatrical productions, comedy troupes, forensics, political and community service groups, literary publications, and coverage of news online, in print, or on air. The list of opportunities is practically infinite. 
What the School Says...
Emerson has more than 80 student organizations and performance groups, 14 NCAA teams, student publications, and honor societies. Students use the nearby Boston Common for relaxation and recreational activities such as tennis, softball, running, Quidditch, and ice skating. Rotch Field, located a mile from campus, serves as a practice and playing field for Emerson men's and women's soccer and lacrosse teams as well as the women's softball team. The College features four residence halls, three of which are newly renovated or brand new within the last five years. The Paramount Center serves as a residence hall and includes the renovated 590-seat Paramount Theater, 150-seat Jackie Liebergott Black Box Theatre, rehearsal studios, and many other performing arts-related amenities for students. 
What the School Says...
While many students go to college to find themselves, students go to Emerson to be themselves. They express themselves in words, through images and sounds, in video and film, on radio and television, on the stage, and in the marketplace of products and ideas. Everywhere you turn at Emerson, you will find people who are as passionately engaged in their interests as you are. You will quickly learn that you want to work with and learn from them because they enhance what you do and help you get where you want to be. The moment you walk onto campus, you will see that diversity plays an active role in the Emerson campus. Emerson College alumni have a major presence in the worlds of journalism, public relations, marketing, advertising, law, advocacy, government, health communication, and communication disorders.
