What the School Says...
In 1785, the University of Georgia became America's first state-chartered university. We take our designation as "the first" very seriously. UGA students are always the first: to volunteer, to engage, to question, to take action. They are on the front lines, leading by example, blazing new paths and creating a better world. A recent article in The New York Times said the following about the University of Georgia: "Seemingly overnight, one of the South's largest public universities has become enormously competitive." Situated on 605 acres in northeast Georgia, UGA enrolls 35,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students in 17 colleges and schools.
What the School Says...
UGA seeks outstanding students who demonstrate personal maturity and integrity; understand and respect intellectual, social, and cultural differences; are committed to school activities, community service, leadership, and family; and will benefit from and contribute to a diverse community of scholar-citizens.
What the School Says...
Consistently rated as one of the "Best Buys" in higher education, UGA ranks fourth on SmartMoney Magazine's list of schools providing the best return on investment. UGA's Foundation Fellowship scholarship provides top scholars with generous support to conduct self-directed travel study. UGA students receive some of the most prestigious scholarships awarded to American undergraduates.
What the School Says...
With more than 170 fields of study and majors as diverse as risk management and real estate, wildlife sciences, computer systems engineering, and broadcast news, the opportunities to find your niche at UGA seem endless. You can interact closely with the faculty by taking part in programs such as our First-Year Seminars, which are limited to 15 students and focus on student/professor interaction. You can also choose the First-Year Learning Communities, a residential program where students with similar interests take classes together. Our nationally recognized honors program houses the Center for Undergraduate Research Opportunities (CURO), which enables undergraduate students to engage in research with premier research faculty.
What the School Says...
UGA sponsors more than 650 student organizations that provide ample opportunities for personal growth and an active lifestyle, including community service groups, club and intramural sports, leadership development programs, sororities and fraternities, the Redcoat Marching Band, and  a wide range of student associations. The Offices of Institutional Diversity and Minority Services and Programs actively support and promote diversity within the University of Georgia community.
What the School Says...
Undergraduate students at UGA come from all 50 states and 121 different countries.  All new first-year students participate in the First Year Odyssey Program, a 15-person seminar class taught by senior faculty. Seminars cover diverse topics such as "Chocolate Science," "How to be a YouTube Sensation," and "The Zombie Plague." More than 94 percent of first-year students return for their second year at UGA.
