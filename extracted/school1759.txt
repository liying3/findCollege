What the School Says...
Founded in 1844, Hillsdale College is a nonsectarian, private, coed, liberal arts college located on a picturesque 400-acre campus in southern Michigan. With a patriotic national reputation for operating independently of government subsidy, we serve a student body of 1,400 students. Our rigorous, structured, core curriculum is rooted in the enduring truths of the Western tradition. Graduates are placed at a rate of 96 percent within six months of graduation and are equipped not only for employment or graduate study, but for the broader work of virtuous living.  All students sign an Honor Code: "A Hillsdale College student is honorable in conduct, honest in word and deed, dutiful in study and service, and respectful of the rights of others. Through education, the student rises to self-government."
What the School Says...
Admission to Hillsdale College is a privilege extended to students who will benefit from and contribute to the academic and social environment of the College. Important qualifications include intellectual curiosity, motivation, ambition, and social concern. Grades, extracurricular activities, interviews, volunteerism, work experience, and recommendations are each reviewed carefully and are important in the evaluation process. While some factors are necessarily more important than others, seldom is any one criterion decisive. Fall term applicants are reviewed according to a set of early and regular admission plans, while spring applicants are reviewed on a rolling basis. In addition to its own paper and online applications, Hillsdale College also accepts and is a member of The Common Application. 
What the School Says...
Hillsdale College is committed to providing the best education at the most reasonable cost and is regularly named a "Best Value." Because of its principled independence from federal and state taxpayer support, privately-funded assistance is granted to qualifying students. More than $20 million is allocated annually to financial aid, including institutional scholarships, grants, and loans. To supplement a family's contribution and to make private education affordable, we offer scholarships based on academic performance, extracurricular involvement, athletic ability, and fine arts talents. In addition, we provide need-based scholarships, grants, and low-interest loans. Application for need-based aid is through the College's Confidential Family Financial Statement (CFFS) form. No formal application in addition to the complete application for admission is required for awards granted apart from need. 
What the School Says...
A liberal education at Hillsdale College entails the study of things good, true, and beautiful. As stated in the College Honor Code, this study "develops the minds and improves the hearts" of students, through which they rise to the challenge of self-government in a free republic. Students refine their intelligence, furnish their understanding, and acquire the abilities and wisdom necessary to lead full, humane lives. In so doing, students, like the College itself, become trustees of "modern man's intellectual and spiritual inheritance from the Judeo-Christian faith and Greco-Roman culture." Through both a liberal arts core curriculum and a chosen major, students are conducted systematically through stages of intellectual growth and acquirement in a variety of disciplines, each worthy of study for its own sake. 
What the School Says...
While Hillsdale students are known for their curiosity and love of learning, their accomplishments outside the classroom are equally impressive. With a student body representing all sections of America as well as several foreign countries, students' interests and talents are as wide-ranging as their geographic profile. Non-classroom opportunities abound, whether students are athletes, visual or performing artists, aspiring writers or journalists, community service volunteers, or want to participate in student government or Greek life. Over 100 clubs, organizations, and honoraries enrich the campus atmosphere, and they are devoted to topics as varied as astronomy, philosophy, film, politics, poetry, outdoor recreation, and foreign cuisine. 
What the School Says...
Hillsdale College aims to provide an education that "will best develop the minds and improve the hearts" of its students. In pursuit of this aim, which is stated in its Articles of Association, Hillsdale students immerse themselves in the liberal arts in the fullest sense. The education they receive hones the intellect, but also shapes the soul in profound ways, both morally and spiritually. Given this comprehensive education, Hillsdale students develop a deep understanding of the requirements of success, and a unique capacity to achieve it. As its 96 percent post-graduation placement rate proves, Hillsdale graduates are prepared to be successful in a wide range of vocations, ultimately best prepared for the broader work of building a virtuous life.
