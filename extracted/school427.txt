 What the School Says... Lebanon Valley College feels like family. That's because we're small. Founded in 1866, today LVC has 1,630 full-time undergraduate students, 160 part-time undergraduates, 120 graduate students, and 100 full-time faculty. We feel more like a large, welcoming family than an impersonal institution.
What the School Says...Our application process is rolling. We encourage completed applications by March 1 for fall admission and December 1 for spring admission. Music, physical therapy, and education are competitive majors. Visit our website for specific information about these programs. Submission of standardized tests is optional.

What the School Says...Lebanon Valley College is committed to helping families afford a quality education. Ninety-eight percent of all LVC students receive some form of financial assistance through merit-based and/or need-based financial aid programs. Our merit-based scholarship program is simple: If you have earned a place in the top 30 percent of your high school class, LVC will recognize your achievement with a scholarship worth one quarter to one half the cost of tuition.
What the School Says...Lebanon Valley College is a small college with an excellent academic reputation. Three ingredients contribute to our success: faculty members who truly love to teach, a selection of 35 majors that combine the liberal arts with a real-world career focus, and exceptional personal attention. We don't offer every program under the sun, but what we do offer, we do very well.
What the School Says...Our residential, tree-lined campus offers a full range of campus activities including intercollegiate and intramural sports, 18 musical clubs, more than 60 campus organizations, bus trips to major cities and local attractions, opportunities to serve the community, and much more!
