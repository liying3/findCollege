What the School Says...
Georgia Southern University, located in Statesboro, Ga., about 50 miles northeast of Savannah, is a traditional, residential campus where each
student is a person, not a number. While Georgia Southern is a major
Doctoral/Research University, you will still find outstanding professors and
a friendly, personal environment with all of the individual attention you
need to succeed. At Georgia's "large-scale, small-feel" research university,
you'll get the best of both worlds. 
What the School Says...
For freshman admission, Georgia Southern requires SAT or ACT test
scores, a satisfactory academic GPA, and completion of the college
preparatory curriculum in high school. Minimum test score requirements are a 
SAT total score of 1010 (math and critical reading only) or an ACT composite score
of 21. There are two freshman application deadlines, one at the beginning of December for spring admission and one at the beginning of May for fall
admission. For transfer admission, Georgia Southern requires completion of
30 transferable semester hours and at least a 2.0 cumulative college GPA.
There are two transfer student application deadlines, one at the beginning
of December for spring admission and one at the beginning of August for fall
admission.
What the School Says...
Rated by Kiplinger Personal Finance as one of the "Top 100 Best Values in
Public Colleges and Universities," our focus is on YOU, the student. Our
Office of Financial Aid has counselors available to prospective students.
We know that funding college can be difficult and we want to help make it as
easy as possible.
What the School Says...
With 124 degree programs, Georgia Southern gives you the
opportunity to shape your academic experience according to your own
interests and aspirations. Your academic advisor helps you identify
your degree program and then works with you to create a road map to complete
it.
What the School Says...
On-campus living, required for all first-time freshmen, is cutting edge at
Georgia Southern. Students can choose between ten residence halls, including
suite- and apartment-style living. The Recreation Activity Center is key to
keeping students fit and healthy. The newly renovated facility features
indoor multipurpose courts, weight/fitness rooms, a three-story climbing wall,
and indoor/outdoor pools. Said one Georgia Southern student, "I loved every
minute of my college experience. The campus was not too big, but not too
small. Unlike some colleges where your classrooms may be spread across the
town, I love how all of Georgia Southern's buildings are located along the
Pedestrium. You feel like you know what's going on around campus and that you have access to participate."
What the School Says...
As a big university, we offer a lot! Not only thousands of course options
and over 124 degrees, but also a constant buzz of activity: big-time sporting events, spirited intramurals, lively study sessions, and intense research
opportunities. All within a setting of stately old buildings, gleaming new
facades, and a peaceful green campus dotted with trees and lakes. That's
Georgia Southern.
