What the School Says...
At Widener, we believe that academic excellence, career preparation, and civic engagement lead to success. When they are not engaged in experiential learning assignments, our students and faculty members lend a hand through community service projects in our hometown, Chester, and in communities around the world. And with Philadelphia only 20 minutes away, we have a living laboratory where students earn practical experience through internships and co-op opportunities. Our beautiful 110-acre main campus is a great place to live, study, and have fun.
What the School Says...
Two to four weeks. That's how long it takes to hear from us, after your application is complete. Admission decisions are made on a rolling basis. But bear in mind that we give merit scholarships to early applicants. Letters of recommendation and an essay are not required. However, if you submit them, we'll add them to your file. 
What the School Says...
Our undergraduate financial aid program is generous. We offer numerous scholarships and can help you obtain additional financial aid to make your costs manageable and affordable. More than 90 percent of our current full-time, first-year undergraduate students received assistance through scholarships and grants.
What the School Says...
Some people are doers. Others are thinkers. We believe that great leaders excel at being both. That's the whole point of our 41 undergraduate majors and ten dual majors, which include top-ranked pre-professional programs in medicine, law, and physical therapy. Through rigorous academics, hands-on classroom projects, and real-world internships and co-op opportunities, you'll gain the knowledge and skills you need to succeed in today's world.
What the School Says...
From co-ed residence halls to sororities and fraternities to Living Learning Communities, our smoke-free, wireless campus has housing options to suit all tastes. Students in our Living Learning Communities live in some of the choicest on-campus "real estate" and collaborate on hands-on projects that connect Widener with the local community. Plus, whether you're a competitive athlete or just want to keep fit, you'll enjoy our modern recreational facilities and a variety of co-ed intramural and club sports. Need more?
