What the School Says...
Putting the liberal arts into practice defines Beloit College.  Beloit students put their education into action both in and out of the classroom through rigorous academics, internships, research opportunities, community service, and global engagement. Offering majors in over 50 fields in 19 departments, Beloit prepares its students to become leaders in the 21st century.  Classes are small (average class size is 15), and faculty serve as students' advisors, helping to shape a meaningful course of study through the college's flexible curriculum.  With extensive opportunities for collaborative research, overseas study, internships, and community service, students plunge into campus life and emerge with the experiences and global knowledge that fill both a transcript and a resum.   
What the School Says...
As important as high achievement in a strong college preparatory program is, the admissions committee approaches each applicant as an individual and reviews the student's work, essays, and recommendations holistically. A founding member of Loren Pope's Colleges That Change Lives, Beloit is looking for students who wish to forge a powerful partnership with a college that abounds with opportunities and with a faculty committed to teaching excellence. Although Beloit continues to require scores from either the SAT or the ACT as part of the application process, standardized tests play a minor role in our review. We do not consider the writing exams for purposes of admission or placement.  
What the School Says...
Over 85 percent of Beloit students receive financial aid, with the average financial aid award exceeding $24,000.  Beloit offers both merit and need-based aid. We require the FAFSA and the Beloit College Financial Aid Application, both of which should be submitted as soon after January 1 as possible and by March 1 for full consideration.  
What the School Says...
Beloit has long been recognized for curricular innovation, and the faculty continues to mentor and advise students to chart their own intellectual path.  The flexible curriculum encourages students to study broadly across the sciences, humanities, social sciences, and the arts, then dig deeply into a major field of study (sometimes more than one major field). Students are required to have at least one "liberal arts in practice" experience, which can range from an internship, research opportunity, study abroad, performance, or more.
What the School Says...
With more than 100 clubs and organizations, 19 varsity sports including men's and women's lacrosse, outstanding guest lecturers, performers from the region and around the world, campus life is rich and full. Residence halls are 90 percent occupied on the weekends. Beloit is an NCAA Division III institution with 17 of the varsity sports competing in the Midwest Conference. 
What the School Says...
Beloit students cannot be stereotyped although unifying descriptors include creative, entrepreneurial, and passionate.  Beloit ranks 20th out of over 2,000 colleges and universities in producing future Ph.D.s and 11th among the nation's most selective liberal arts colleges in the proportion of alumni Ph.D.s. The first-to-second-year retention rate is more than 90 percent.
