What the School Says...
 Rhodes is a national, highly selective college committed to the liberal arts and sciences. Our highest priorities are intellectual engagement, service to others, and honor among ourselves. We enjoy one of the country's most beautiful campuses in the heart of Memphis, an economic, political and cultural center, making Rhodes one of a handful of prominent liberal arts colleges in a major metropolitan area. 
 Rhodes has been named America's #1 Service-Oriented College by Newsweek, and has garnered accolades from Princeton Review, U.S. News, and Forbes. Rhodes is also profiled in the prestigious Colleges That Changes Lives.
What the School Says...
Successful Rhodes applicants can demonstrate their readiness for our challenging academics. We look for highly motivated students who have demonstrated high academic achievement, as well as creativity, character, and leadership skills. Rhodes practices holistic admission, meaning that our evaluation reviews each student's high school transcript, standardized test scores, a written essay, extracurricular activities, and school and teacher recommendations. Demonstrated interest is an important consideration in our admission decisions and we recommend that applicants be personally engaged with the college by visiting with the Admission staff on campus, in their high school, or in their communities.  The better we know you, the better we know if you and Rhodes are a good fit.  
What the School Says...
More than 93 percent of our students receive some form of financial assistance (fellowships, scholarships, grants, loans, student employment). Rhodes annually awards more than $5.9 million in achievement-based scholarships and fellowships.  Scholarship awards range from $8,000 to full tuition and there is no separate application to be considered for general merit scholarships.  Applications for fellowship consideration in physics, service learning, or the fine arts are available. We encourage families to complete both the FAFSA and the CSS Profile to ensure they receive full consideration for federal, state and institutional need-based aid programs.  
What the School Says...
Prepare yourself for a lifetime of learning at Rhodes. Our vision of a liberal education balances rigorous classroom academics with the challenge of putting these lessons into action. At Rhodes, you'll be encouraged to engage in research, leadership and service opportunities, and to take responsibility for shaping your educational experience to meet your personal interests and goals. 
Our goal is to graduate students with the ability to transform their communities, so we offer a variety of degree options, plus opportunities for pre-professional and dual-degree programs, study abroad, and honor societies. Rhodes graduates have an exceptionally high rate of acceptance into graduate schools and professional programs.
What the School Says...
For over 100 years, our Honor Code has built a campus-wide community of trust and mutual respect.  Nearly 100 percent of our first-year students live on campus and this residential campus environment has over 100 clubs and organizations for students to join. Almost all of our students participate in community service activities. Our Division III athletic teams are part of the Southern Athletic Conference. The picturesque Rhodes campus is located in an attractive Midtown neighborhood, only a few miles from downtown Memphis. In addition to on-campus activities, students take advantage of Memphis for theatre, professional sports, delicious restaurants, museums, and of course great live music!   
What the School Says...
 Our 2,000 undergraduate students learn how to become essential in the classroom, on campus and in the community.  Seventy-five percent of our students complete internships and 65 percent study abroad during their time at Rhodes.  These experiences translate to more than 90 percent of our students being employed or in graduate school within one year of graduation.  Our acceptance rates to graduate programs are typically 91 to 100 percent, and two thirds of our students are admitted to their first-choice graduate program. Rhodes' student body represents 46 states (plus D.C.) and 11 countries and includes 21 percent students of color. Seventy-five percent of our students are from outside the state of Tennessee.
