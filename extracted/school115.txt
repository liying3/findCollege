What the School Says...
Quinnipiac is committed to three important values: providing academic programs of high quality, maintaining a student-centered environment, and nurturing a strong sense of community. Located in Hamden, Connecticut, Quinnipiac provides the best of the suburbs and the city. The University is only eight miles from New Haven and less than two hours from New York City and Boston. Bordering the campus is the 1,700-acre Sleeping Giant State Park, for walking and hiking. The free campus shuttle takes students to nearby shopping and restaurants.  Quinnipiac is consistently ranked among the best universities by U.S. News & World Report and recognized by Princeton Review as being among The Best 376 Colleges. 
What the School Says...
Quinnipiac takes a holistic approach when considering candidates for admission. While standardized test scores are an important factor, so too are high school grades, the difficulty level of completed coursework, activities, life experiences, and special talents or skills. Quinnipiac has a rolling admission policy for its undergraduate programs. Since we review files as they become complete, we encourage freshman applicants to apply early in the fall of their senior year of high school, but no later than the suggested deadline of February 1. Students applying to the physical therapy, nursing, or physician assistant programs should submit their application materials by November 15. An early decision option is available for all programs, with a deadline of November 1.
What the School Says...
The Quinnipiac University Office of Financial Aid works with all applicants to assure that they receive the maximum state and federal aid for which they are eligible. About 80 percent of Quinnipiac students receive financial aid through a combination of grants, scholarships, work-study, and student loans. The University offers a range of merit-based scholarships to incoming freshmen based on their high school record and test scores.
What the School Says...
Quinnipiac is where students who want a personal, challenging education come to learn.  Undergraduate students can choose from over 50 majors through the Schools of Business and Engineering, Communications, Education, Health Sciences, and the College of Arts and Sciences. Undergraduate programs offer a dynamic combination of classroom and hands-on learning through internships and clinical experiences designed to prepare students for career entry or advanced studies. Opportunities for student research, service learning, and study abroad further enhance students' academic and personal growth. With a student-to-faculty ratio of 16:1 and an average class size of about 25, Quinnipiac provides an ideal environment where professors know their students by name and are readily accessible to each of them.  Our award-winning academic buildings offer ample space for discussion, hands-on learning, and the latest technology.
What the School Says...
Quinnipiac offers more than 100 student organizations for just about every interest, from performing arts to politics to broadcasting. Greek life is available through six fraternities and seven sororities. We offer a wide variety of intramural sports and 21 intercollegiate NCAA Division I athletic teams. For freshmen and sophomores, the Mount Carmel campus is home to the library, academic buildings, a student center, a 24,000-square-foot recreation facility, and playing fields. Residence halls with traditional rooms and suites (some with kitchens) are available. For juniors and seniors, the nearby 250-acre York Hill campus houses the TD Bank Sports Center with twin 3,500-seat arenas for ice hockey and basketball. New apartment- and suite-style residence halls are available, along with a lodge-style student center which includes a dining hall, meeting and study space, a fitness center, plus magnificent views of the surrounding area.
What the School Says...
Quinnipiac offers the warmth and spirit of a small town. You'll feel it the moment a huge team of upperclassmen helps you unload your vehicle as you move in to your freshman residence hall. The First-Year Residential Experience program is designed to help first-year students have a positive transition into college life. It focuses on the Department of Residential Life's core values of community, diversity, service, and responsibility. The experience helps students build meaningful relationships with fellow residents in their hall and make lasting connections with the university-wide community. We believe that differences enrich every aspect of university life and lead to a heightened sense of community. We welcome students from diverse backgrounds: 16 percent of our most recent incoming class self-identified as students of color. Our currently enrolled undergraduates come to us from 23 states and 47 countries. Eighty-seven percent of freshmen return to Quinnipiac for their sophomore year and 77 percent graduate within six years.
