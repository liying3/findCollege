What the School Says...
Gonzaga University is in Spokane, Washington, a city of 208,000 people (609,000 in the metropolitan area) that serves as the financial, medical, and cultural center of the Inland Northwest. Gonzaga's grass-covered, 131-acre campus has 105 buildings on the north bank of the beautiful Spokane River. The city offers vast opportunities for students to pursue their interests, such as internships with local businesses or any of the multitude of outdoor activities characteristic of the magnificent Pacific Northwest. Gonzaga's educational philosophy is based on the centuries-old Ignatian model of educating the whole person: mind, body, and spirit. At Gonzaga, students discover how to integrate science and art, faith and reason, action and contemplation. "Cura personalis," or care for the whole person, guides the University curriculum and environment.


What the School Says...
Gonzaga takes a holistic approach to admission by reviewing academic measures, student involvement, and citizenship. Gonzaga looks for motivated students who will benefit from the University's challenging academic programs and will positively contribute to the campus with extracurricular achievement, community involvement, and diverse personal interests. Apply by submitting the Common Application by February 1, including the Application Supplement. Gonzaga also offers a non-binding Early Action deadline of November 15.




What the School Says...
To apply for merit-based financial aid, submit the Application for Admission by February 1. Based on this information, the Admission Office will determine eligibility for merit-based scholarships that can range from $3,500 to $15,500 per year. To apply for need-based financial aid, submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by February 1. Gonzaga also has numerous scholarships for incoming students that require a separate application. The University guarantees your Gonzaga-funded scholarships, and grants will not decrease if you maintain satisfactory academic standing during your continuous, full-time, four-year undergraduate enrollment.


What the School Says...
The academic heart of Gonzaga's liberal arts tradition lies in its core curriculum, which integrates philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, literature, and the natural and social sciences. A common thread throughout all of these disciplines is the value of the written word; students at Gonzaga carry out extensive writing projects throughout all of their courses of study. Gonzaga offers seven undergraduate degrees in over 45 majors. The average undergraduate class size is 23 and the student-to-faculty ratio is 11:1. Gonzaga also offers study abroad programs in over 35 countries, including its longest-running and most popular program, Gonzaga-in-Florence.


What the School Says...
When asked about the "best" part of being a Zag, many current students will talk about the community. Much of that community begins in the residence halls. Due to Gonzaga's residency requirement, 97.5 percent of first-year students and 88 percent of second-year students live on campus. While housing is not guaranteed for upper division students, some of them continue living on campus in apartments or Gonzaga-owned houses. Together, this represents almost 3,000 residents living in over 25 unique residential communities. Students will find their experiences with GU exciting and inclusive. Gonzaga currently has over 100 active and recognized student clubs that cover a wide range of interests.


What the School Says...
Gonzaga enjoys a strong retention rate of over 90 percent (93.4 percent in 2011) and a 73 percent four-year graduation rate for the 2008 cohort (an 80.9 percent five-year graduation rate for the 2007 cohort).  Gonzaga offers extracurricular and co-curricular opportunities that invite students to take an active role in shaping their own college experience. In taking responsibility for their journey, and contributing to their environment at Gonzaga, students learn leadership, critical thinking, and other skills that will make them valuable resources in their future communities and professional roles. To support career development, the ZagTrax.net website offers information about jobs, internships, networking and recruiting events, and mentors. The Gonzaga Alumni Mentor Program (GAMP) matches students with GU alumni and friends of the University.  Students connect one-on-one with their mentors, and GAMP provides larger networking opportunities in Spokane and a number of other cities.
