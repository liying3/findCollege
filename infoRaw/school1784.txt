While you have the option of submitting a paper application for admission, we strongly encourage you to apply online. Doing so allows you to self-report your academic information instead of having your high school send us your most recent transcript. It also means that you can expect to receive an e-mail indicating your admission status only two business days after you submit the online application!

We process applications beginning approximately one year prior to each term of entry. The earlier you apply and accept your offer of admission, the more options you will have for financial aid, scholarships, course selection, and housing. Your early acceptance will also give you plenty of time to register for our orientation programs.
