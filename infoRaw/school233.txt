What the School Says...
Colby, founded in 1813 and one of America's best liberal arts colleges, combines a challenging academic program, an emphasis on undergraduate research, and an active community life, all on one of the nation's most beautiful campuses. Colby's reach is global, in our recruitment of a diverse student body and faculty, in the scope of our curriculum, and in the number of undergraduates who study abroad. Located in Waterville, Maine, Colby is 20 minutes from the state capital and about an hour from Portland, Maine's largest city. 


What the School Says...
Colby seeks intellectually ambitious applicants who will contribute to and enhance our community in a variety of ways. Top academic performers who are also dedicated to activities outside of the classroom rise to the top of the application pool. We value diversity and students from all parts of the country and the world. Once we receive your application, your admissions counselor, along with two other members of the admissions team, will review it meticulously before making a final decision.





What the School Says...
We believe no qualified student should miss out on a great education, and we have a number of institutional commitments in place to help make a Colby education affordable. Specific commitments include: meeting 100 percent of need as determined by the college for all admitted students, excluding loans from financial aid packages, making financial aid portable to qualified study-abroad programs, and waiving application fees for students who submit their applications online. 


What the School Says...
Colby has a reputation for academic excellence in the liberal arts. If you want small classes, professors who know your name, and the opportunity to learn by doing, Colby may be the college for you. Classes are rigorous and expectations are high. You'll work hard and graduate with an understanding of the world and the skills to make a difference in whatever career you choose. Colby's 54 majors and 31 minors are divided into four academic divisions and students have the flexibility to sample from all of them. 


What the School Says...
Ever heard of broomball? Want to try quilting, pottery, or a cappella? Interested in writing for the student newspaper, debating politics, or hiking the Grand Canyon? Colby has more than 100 student clubs, numerous club sports, and a ton of other things to engage your body and brain. To supplement campus events, Waterville's restaurants, retail stores, and coffee shops are only a few minutes' drive from campus (and there's Colby's shuttle, "the Jitney"). And students are always planning trips to the mountains or ocean for sightseeing, skiing, or surfing, and to Portland for music, arts, and food culture.


What the School Says...
Every year a new class graduates from Colby ready to change the world. Eighty-two percent of the Class of 2012 was employed, was admitted to grad school, or had received full-time fellowships. Colby's liberal arts curriculum, combined with guidance from the Career Center and an active alumni network, prepares students for postgraduate success in nearly every field imaginable. In addition, Colby offers a four-year program that includes workshops, networking, grad school prep, and internship and job shadowing experiences to help students prepare and plan for the future.
