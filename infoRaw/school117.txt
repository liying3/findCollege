What the School Says...
The University of Rochester seeks to admit students who will take advantage of its resources, be strongly motivated to do their best, and contribute to the life of the university community. An applicant's character, academic accomplishments, and career goals are considered. Admission to the College is based on a holistic review process that includes a "test-flexible" philosophy. In addition to submitting a record of courses and grades during secondary school, applicants must show evidence of preparation through examination results. A wide variety of test results can fulfill this requirement, including the SAT, the ACT, results from two or more SAT Subject Tests, Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate tests, and results from many other national secondary exams.


What the School Says...
The University offers a strong program of financial assistance, including academic merit scholarships, grants, loans, tuition payment plans, and part-time jobs. Applicants should submit the CSS PROFILE application and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).


What the School Says...
Excellence requires freedom. At Rochester, you build your own curriculum. There are no required subjects. You study what you're passionate about. Rochester offers 65 degree programs in humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering.  Among America's advanced research universities, Rochester is the most collegiate in character, with smaller enrollment overall and a commitment that 95-100 percent of every student's course instruction will be from a tenure-track faculty member. Undergraduate students base their learning on their individual interests, receiving guidance to pursue both a broad liberal education and the specialized fields of their choice. Through this process, they learn to prioritize their interests and take pride in their decisions.


What the School Says...
The campus is residential and self-contained, but an exciting small-city downtown is two miles away, and year-round recreation is prominent in all directions. The university is a community where about 86 percent of undergraduates live on campus.
