What the School Says...
Like most private colleges, Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, offers a small student-faculty ratio (9:1) and average class size (15). Unlike most private colleges, Lawrence teaches an extraordinary number of individualized courses. These are honors projects, tutorials, or studio lessons where one student works directly with a professor. Of the 2,000 courses we teach each year, nearly two-thirds have total enrollments of one. By the time they graduate, 90 percent of our students will have had at least one individualized class.


What the School Says...
In March 2005, Lawrence University adopted a test-optional policy giving students the choice to submit or not to submit their standardized test results for our admission and scholarship review. In each of the years since, approximately 25 percent of our applicants have chosen to let their academic records stand on their own without a test score. (And they have done just fine, thank you.)


What the School Says...
Your investment of time, energy, and money into your college education returns much more than a degree. It provides you with a set of opportunities, friendships, and experiences that will help shape your life. We encourage you to discover the value that a Lawrence education provides, and see why the average Lawrence student leaves with only a few thousand dollars more in student loans than the national average.


What the School Says...
To participate in a liberal education is a privilege and a challenge; to be liberally educated is to be transformed. Open and free inquiry, a devotion to excellence, the development of character, the mastery of competencies, the ability to think critically, the excitement and rewards of learning, these are the aims and principles of a liberal arts education.


What the School Says...
Where else but Lawrence will you find students and faculty speaking German together at a weekly Kaffeeklatsch? The world's longest-running trivia contest? College Democrats and College Republicans who speak to each other? A Battle Games Association and Amnesty International? A campus community fed in part by a SLUG (the Sustainable Lawrence University Garden)?


What the School Says...
Lawrence students are a multitalented and multi-interested group. When we review applications for each class, we are always fascinated and impressed by the breadth of experiences students bring with them. Among the newest class of Lawrentians, we have a student who won first place in an interschool swimming competition for backstroke, was a U.S. junior synchronized figure skating champion, broke six minutes in the mile, was a swim captain two years in a row, and last but not least, inspired two small boys to become interested in music after they attended a performance with their father.
