What the School Says...

Grand View University is a liberal arts university offering undergraduate and graduate education. Founded more than 100 years ago, Grand View offers an academically challenging, career-oriented, liberal arts-grounded curriculum to a diverse student body at two campus locations in greater Des Moines. Because of our ties to the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, we help students learn to think critically, informed by both faith and reason, and learn about God and themselves through a variety of ways of knowing.



What the School Says...
 As a Grand View student, you'll be immersed in studying and preparing for your future career, but you'll also have the opportunity to study abroad in such locations as Denmark, Brazil, France, and Italy. Learning about another culture, in another country, helps you appreciate the diversity of the world, and it may help you discover how very similar cultures actually are. It's also a lot of fun! Grand View has state-of-the-art computer and testing facilities as well as Wi-Fi on campus. Internet is provided in campus housing, and commuter students can use Wi-Fi hot spots or one of the many computer labs.
