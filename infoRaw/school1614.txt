Freshman students should make sure to apply for admissions by December 1 for priority merit-based scholarship consideration or meet our regular deadline of February 1. Transfer students have various deadlines depending on their intended semester of entry. Old Dominion requires freshman applicants to submit their official SAT scores for critical reading and mathematics or their ACT scores. Test scores must be sent directly from the testing agency or included on the official high school transcript. Transfer students who graduated from high school less than two years prior to their application must submit official SAT or ACT scores.
