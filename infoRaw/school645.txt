What the School Says...
Fort Lewis College is a public, four-year liberal arts college in Durango, Colorado, that prepares you for a rewarding personal life and a successful career. The hallmark of the academic experience is students working directly and closely with faculty who are experts in their fields, caring and attentive mentors, and amazing teachers. Sal, a junior, says, "I feel the professors really see my potential."


What the School Says...
Your transcript and your test scores are not the only factors we want to consider in admission. For this reason, we strongly recommend that students provide additional information through a personal essay and letters of recommendation. Our admission philosophy is "first come, first served," so there are real advantages to applying by January 15 for admission in the fall. Once you're admitted you can reserve housing, make an advising appointment, qualify for scholarships, and sign up for special opportunities. 


What the School Says...
In a recent survey, 85 percent of Fort Lewis applicants found the school to be very affordable, citing its reasonable tuition, fee, and room-and-board rates; its competitive scholarships and need-based aid packages; and its extensive opportunities for part-time employment. Sarah, a junior, says, "Thanks to my scholarship and my campus job, I'm going to graduate with two majors in four years."


What the School Says...
Fort Lewis offers 95 academic specialties through majors, minors, and certificates balanced by a liberal arts core that emphasizes broad intellectual exploration. Our most popular majors are Business Administration, Biology, Psychology, Art, English, Exercise Science, Teacher Education, Sociology/Human Services, History, Accounting, Adventure Education, Political Science, and Environmental Studies.


What the School Says...
Students who live on campus get more out of college because lectures, films, libraries, computer labs, and recreational activities are just steps away. So are mountains, deserts, rivers, and canyons. As Ashley, a junior, says, "The whole outdoors setting is amazing!" The Outdoor Pursuits program, which guides and outfits student adventures, makes getting outside easy and affordable.


What the School Says...
At Fort Lewis, you will explore your intellect; develop your powers of critical analysis, writing, and speaking; prepare for leadership; and integrate your learning through Freshmen Learning Communities. You will also learn by studying abroad and participating in community service, undergraduate research, internships, and other hands-on learning opportunities.
