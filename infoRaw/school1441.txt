What the School Says...
The Rutgers campus in New Brunswick is where New Jersey's state university took root in 1766. Rutgers is the eighth oldest institution of higher learning in the United States and New Jersey's only public university in the Association of American Universities (AAU), an organization composed of the most distinguished research institutions in North America. Students choose Rutgers-New Brunswick because it has all the advantages of a small school and all the resources of a leading research university. It includes ten schools offering more than 100 undergraduate majors and five residential campus communities. Rutgers-New Brunswick's central location between New York City and Philadelphia provides you with access to hundreds of employers and thousands of internships. In an hour by train or car you can find yourself applauding a Broadway performance, hiking or skiing mountain trails, exploring an art museum in Philadelphia, or soaking up the sun at the famous Jersey Shore.



What the School Says...
We select students based upon a comprehensive review of each application. We place primary emphasis on a student's academic promise as demonstrated by high school performance, cumulative rank (when available), weighted grade-point average(s), grade trends, completion of required entrance subjects, strength of academic program, and SAT and/or ACT scores. Rutgers also considers such qualitative factors as personal essay; participation in college-prep programs; extracurricular activities, community, volunteer, and/or U.S. military service; honors and awards; employment; family obligations; special talents; and socioeconomic background. 


What the School Says...
Rutgers offers an exceptional education at an affordable price. The Wall Street Journal's SmartMoney magazine ranked Rutgers #6 in the nation and #1 in the Northeast for value. Options are available for students who need help financing their Rutgers education.  More than 86 percent of all Rutgers students receive some type of financial aid.


What the School Says...

What the School Says...
Fitness centers for a yoga class. Eateries to grab a smoothie or a wrap. Lectures from world-class thinkers. Whether you're looking for a peaceful corner of campus to reflect or a jam-packed, cheering crowd to get the adrenaline going, you'll find it here at Rutgers. There are hundreds of student clubs, spacious venues for sporting events, and plenty of options for dining and housing.  Rutgers is made smaller by its many communities: schools, campuses, residence halls, learning communities, research teams, intramural clubs, student groups, and more. And Rutgers has a carefully developed network of formal support systems to connect you with everything we offer.
