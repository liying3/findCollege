What the School Says...
Colgate University is a highly selective residential liberal arts institution distinguished by the dedication of its faculty and its commitment to global engagement, student-faculty research, off-campus study, sustainable practices, and utilizing technology to enhance the teaching and learning experience. Colgate offers 53 majors to a diverse student body of approximately 2,900 undergraduate students, and supports 25 Division I athletic teams. The university's 515-acre campus in rural central New York is renowned for its beauty and for the important role it plays in the student experience.




What the School Says...
Academic achievement and intellectual potential are the primary criteria for admission. Colgate also values demonstrated leadership, curiosity, and substantive involvement in extracurricular and community activities. The breadth and depth of a student's interests, both in and out of the classroom, are important factors in the admission evaluation. 


What the School Says...
Many people assume that they cannot afford a private, highly selective liberal arts college such as Colgate.  However, need-based financial aid can help bridge the gap between what a family is asked to contribute and the full cost of attendance. For students receiving financial aid during their first year of college, our financial aid awards typically consist of grants, a modest student loan, and a campus job opportunity, with grant funds generally representing the largest portion of the financial aid award.  


What the School Says...
Our liberal arts academic program is more than just classrooms and lectures. World-class faculty, a 9:1 student-faculty ratio, undergraduate research, off-campus study, and a highly regarded core curriculum help students expand their horizons. You can choose from over 50 resource-rich academic majors and a wide variety of minors. Because you are not required to declare a major until the second semester of sophomore year, there is ample opportunity to explore and experiment with your academic interests. Colgate offers pre-professional programs for students interested in pursuing law, engineering, architecture, business/management and financial services, and communications and new media.




What the School Says...
Campus is a friendly and close-knit place where students develop lifelong bonds with Colgate, with each other, and with faculty and staff. Through our 150 clubs, even a first-year can host a radio show on WRCU-FM, help organize the university's organic garden, or learn to bring an entrepreneurial venture to market. Students also join a wide array of religious, cultural, political, and arts groups, and serve the surrounding community. The university's Upstate Institute gives students a way to practice their research and project management skills to benefit non-profit organizations and populations in the region.


What the School Says...
Colgate students are active, curious, social, and ready to learn both inside and outside the classroom. Success in almost any field now demands a global perspective, and that takes more than just travel. From Santa Fe to Kyoto, students have opportunities to immerse themselves in classroom study and cultural experiences throughout the world. As for your future, Colgate's Office of Career Services works to connect students, before and after graduation, with the university's amazing alumni network.
