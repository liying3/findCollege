What the School Says...
Carnegie Mellon University is consistently recognized for its world-class programs from arts to technology, collaboration across disciplines, and innovative leadership in education. The university has produced some of the most distinguished and innovative leaders in the last century. Our 150-acre main campus sits inside the Pittsburgh city limits in the Oakland neighborhood, a community rich with museums, libraries, and entertainment, and home to both Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh.


What the School Says...
The admission process at Carnegie Mellon is highly selective. Every year, thousands of artistically and academically talented students vie for approximately 1,450 spots. Our holistic admission process is about more than just admitting a group of students who have the potential to succeed academically. We're not looking for "perfect" students, but students who are a good fit for Carnegie Mellon and who will add to the overall Carnegie Mellon community. When we review applications, we look at four main areas: your high school performance, extracurricular contributions, demonstrated interest, and standardized test results. It's also important that you have prepared yourself for the major that you're interested in. We pay close attention to your curriculum rigor, the grades you've earned, and the work you've accomplished. If you're applying to one of our fine arts programs, your artistic performance will be the main factor or a significant factor in our admission decision.


What the School Says...
There's no denying it, a private college education like Carnegie Mellon's is expensive. We hope that you and your family will consider the value of a college education from Carnegie Mellon to be an investment in your future. Our need-blind financial assistance program is designed to meet our dual goal of helping prospective students who have demonstrated financial need afford the cost of education and rewarding those students who have outstanding talents and abilities. Need-based financial assistance is used to enroll high-quality students, but not everyone who applies for financial assistance receives an award, or package, from Carnegie Mellon. We first determine if you're eligible for financial assistance, both from the federal and state government and from Carnegie Mellon.


What the School Says...

Academics at Carnegie Mellon span subjects from the arts to technology, creating innovation with impact. Music, engineering, languages, art, and chemistry weave in and out of the lives of our students, creating a foundation of knowledge that will reveal itself in exciting ways. Our alumni have gone on to become Nobel Prize winners, tech company founders, inventors, orchestra conductors, Oscar-winning producers, and more. Carnegie Mellon is widely recognized for its unique interdisciplinary environment, encouraging work across departmental lines. As a result, our graduates enter the world with the ability to solve complex problems. 



What the School Says...
The Carnegie Mellon experience doesn't end inside the classroom. As a Tartan, you'll meet and learn from a geographically and academically diverse group of people. Our students participate in over 250 active student organizations, from service and cultural groups to club sports and academic organizations. Chances are if you're involved in something now, you'll find it here. Our school spirit and traditions are taken seriously on our campus. This spirit dates back to 1900, when Andrew Carnegie wrote, "My heart is in the work." More than 100 years later, those words are still felt on campus in a set of traditions that are uniquely Carnegie Mellon. And you can always find something new to do in Pittsburgh. Between the unique neighborhoods and the 10 colleges with 86,000 students in the area, there's much to explore and many different types of people to meet. 


What the School Says...
Carnegie Mellon students work hard in the classroom, but they're also active outside the classroom. Whether it's competing in the next game, volunteering in the community, or acting on stage, our students know how to balance their interests. Our goal is to create an atmosphere that cultivates a sense of community and diversity while also embracing each student's individuality. Students at Carnegie Mellon represent all 50 states and more than 65 countries. Needless to say, Carnegie Mellon students embody a wide array of backgrounds and cultures. There are also 88,800 living Carnegie Mellon alumni who represent every industry imaginable. From Broadway to Hollywood, working their way up in companies like Facebook and Google, or even creating a start-up with their own innovative idea. Our alumni are making a difference in our society.
