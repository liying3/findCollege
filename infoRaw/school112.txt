What the School Says...
Frequently called a "city within the country," Purchase College sits on a spacious 500-plus acre estate in Westchester County, 10 minutes from downtown White Plains and just 30 miles north of Manhattan. With almost all the buildings centered within a great open space, Purchase College provides students with a vibrant and welcoming environment where they can study, collaborate, and create.


What the School Says...
Purchase seeks to enroll highly motivated, hard-working, and academically strong students with consistent records of achievement in challenging high school curricula. Generally, successful freshman applicants have earned a high school GPA of at least 3.0/85 and a combined SAT score of at least 1100 or better (24 ACT composite). Students who do not meet these exact requirements but demonstrate a compelling academic history (or, in the case of our professional training programs in the visual and performing arts, exceptional artistic talent) may still be considered for admission. Purchase College is committed to admitting a highly qualified and diverse student body poised to succeed in our programs. We holistically review each applicant and consider the various personal experiences and circumstances that have shaped them. 


What the School Says...
Purchase College is committed to offering a quality accessible and affordable education to all admitted students. In addition to need-based financial aid, we offer merit and talent scholarships to eligible students. All candidates for admission are evaluated for scholarship at the time of review. We award as many qualified candidates as our funds allow. Last year, Purchase offered approximately $1.5 million in merit and talent scholarships to academically qualified new and returning students. Incoming freshmen are eligible for several different annual scholarships with awards ranging from $200 to full tuition. Scholarship recipients pursuing BA/BS programs are selected based on academic credentials measured by high school performance and standardized test scores. BFA and MusB candidates are awarded scholarships based on talent demonstrated during the application process.


What the School Says...
The School of Liberal Arts and Sciences offers rich disciplinary and interdisciplinary curricula with extraordinary opportunities for research, study abroad, and preprofessional preparation. Students benefit from close, personal interaction with faculty mentors, small class settings, and an atmosphere fueled by critical thinking and creativity. The School of the Arts provides the highest level of professional training to developing visual and performing artists and arts managers. Students are prepared for careers in their fields and are inspired to be engaged and innovative contributors to society. Arts students are cultivated through rigorous and comprehensive studio practice. Each student's experience culminates in a substantial, year-long Senior Project, which sets our students apart from students of other schools.


What the School Says...
Our motto, "Think Wide Open," describes the residential experience. College is not only about academic development, but social and civic development as well. The exchange of ideas, culture, and outlook does not stop when class is over; it continues through drum circles in our quad, music shows in the student center, deep conversations about theory in the residence halls, all facilitated by our faculty and staff who live on-campus. Purchase is a place where you have the opportunity to make lasting friendships and memories, and where our students are celebrated for being themselves. We feel that campus living combines the essential elements for a successful college experience.


What the School Says...
Purchase students are incredible and unique. Here, artists interact with psychologists, and mathematicians with dancers. It's the perfect environment for students of all majors and interests to learn and collaborate. Our students work hard and care about what they doit's what makes them so great to be around. You'll connect with people and ideas that you didn't think you'd enjoy, and you'll love it! Purchase is a place where you will be both challenged and rewarded, and you will NOT come out the same (in a good way!). The students are a huge part of what makes Purchase a great place to study, and their continued involvement in the Purchase community after graduation proves the lasting value of a Purchase education.
