What the School Says...

Park University is a fully accredited, independent, liberal arts institution founded in 1875. We offer the academic and professional advantages of a private college education at an affordable cost on par with most state universities. Our stunning 700-acre campus is located in Parkville, Mo., just 12 miles from downtown Kansas City. At Park, you will see more, learn more, and do more. You will study world markets, technologies, cultures, and conflicts. More important, you will engage the world as never before. You will develop personal relationships with peers from across the region and every corner of the globe. 



What the School Says...
Park seeks students with a record of academic achievement, involvement in the community, and good character.  Students who have a high school unweighted GPA of 3.0 or above are eligible for admission, regardless of ACT or SAT scores.  Students who qualify for Missouri's A-Plus Program (or an equivalent program in another state) are automatically eligible for freshman admission. Students not meeting the first two criteria qualify for admission by meeting at least two of the following requirements: a 2.0 unweighted grade point average (on a 4.0 scale), a ranking in the upper 50 percent of their high school graduating class, or a minimum ACT composite score of 20 or a combined SAT score of 940 (Critical Reading and Math only).


What the School Says...
Park offers a high-caliber private education at a remarkably affordable cost. Park's reasonable tuition and fees make us a "best value." What's more, there is no out-of-state tuition at Park, a real bonus whether you're from neighboring states or a distant country. Our 135-year-old tradition of providing access to educational opportunity and career success remains a beacon of hope for students and families everywhere.


What the School Says...
As a private institution, Park's classes are small and engaging. A full range of degree options lets you tap into your passions while still getting a well-rounded liberal arts education. Caring professors and small class sizes mean you will receive personal attention to help prepare you for lifelong learning. We offer over 80 degrees from our School of Business, School for Education, School for Natural and Applied Sciences, School for Arts and Humanities, and School for Social Sciences. Our dedicated faculty will help you be successful. Personally designed majors and degrees in Interdisciplinary Studies are available for students who cannot decide on just one major. 


What the School Says...
When you come to Park you will find that it's easy to fill your schedule with a variety of events, including leadership organizations, social gatherings, athletics, intramurals, and community involvement. Park offers the safety and comfort of our Parkville campus, while still keeping you connected to wider worlds of opportunity and activity. From our perch high above the Missouri River, you can see the rooftops of Parkville, a classic American small town. Look in another direction, toward downtown Kansas City, and you sense the excitement of a thriving metropolis of two million people. In other words, you can step away from campus with a short walk to Parkville or a bike ride through English Landing Park, or venture into downtown Kansas City for a day of serious shopping, dining, or live entertainment. No matter what, you will be able to find something just for you!
