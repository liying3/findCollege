What the School Says...Saint Joseph's College of Maine offers academic excellence in a magnificent lakeside location in southern Maine. Saint Joseph's nurtures intellectual, physical, and spiritual growth in students of all faiths in a values-centered environment. Accomplished faculty dedicated to teaching and research help to create a strong sense of community, where students and faculty interact easily and often.


What the School Says...We offer a regular decision admission process and a non-binding early action process. The early action deadline is November 15, with students notified by mid-December. Our regular decision deadline for nursing majors is January 15. The deadline for all other majors is March 1, with students notified on an ongoing basis as their applications become complete. Transfer students should apply by August 1 for the September semester.


What the School Says...
More than 90 percent of Saint Joseph's students do not pay full tuition. Merit scholarships range from $6,000 to $12,000 per year. Saint Joseph's commits more than $8.5 million of its own resources to aid students.


What the School Says...A service learning program allows students to learn in community settings, while making a difference in people's lives. In addition to its diverse majors, Saint Joseph's offers partnership degree programs in pre-engineering, pre-optometry, and pre-pharmacy. The most popular majors include nursing, business, biology, education, and exercise science.


What the School Says...With more than 25 clubs, a host of traditions and festivities, proximity to one of the finest cultural cities on the East Coast, and a four-season recreation area, there is always plenty to do.


What the School Says...Student life at St. Joe's is about connecting. It's making friends in the residence hall and cheering at the basketball game. Or meeting your best friends in the caf for lunch or heading to Portland for the Guster concert. It's about you and your friends checking out the comedian in the Chalet or skiing at Shawnee Peak. It's about sunset kayak trips on Sebago Lake, or taking a polar plunge in the lake to raise money for the student Habitat for Humanity chapter. It's about you and what you want to explore here.
