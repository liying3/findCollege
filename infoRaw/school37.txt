What the School Says...

Saint Michael's College is a selective liberal arts college located next to Burlington, Vermont, one of the best college towns in the country. Education, peace and justice, and service are at the heart of the college. We are a Catholic residential college, and housing is guaranteed. St. Mike's was identified by the Princeton Review as one of the happiest colleges in the country, and was named a top national liberal arts college by U.S. News & World Report.



What the School Says...
The Office of Admission at Saint Michael's is available to answer any questions students or parents have regarding the application process and deadlines. Saint Michael's College offers two early action deadlines along with a regular decision deadline. Saint Michael's College is test optional, but students may select to submit test scores from either the SAT or ACT. If a student takes the SAT more than once, we will take the best score from each test. 


What the School Says...
All admitted students will be considered for merit-based aid. Approximately 90 percent of students on St. Mike's campus receive financial aid. Students seeking need-based aid will need to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. 


What the School Says...
While your college education should prepare you for a career, at St. Mike's, we have a broader perspective: College should prepare you for life. That's why our students start by building a strong liberal studies foundation before they dive deep into their majors. By graduation, they've developed essential skills and knowledge that will help them be successful in any field.


What the School Says...
As a residential college, St. Mike's students spend all four years living on campus. As one student put it, "Everyone's really close. It's a great community to be part of." That strong sense of community encourages growth and learning both in and out of the classroom. Our Student Life and Resident Life teams work to make your residential experience a successful and happy one.


What the School Says...
Saint Michael's students are vibrant, engaged men and women who come from a range of backgrounds and locations, but share the desire to become part of an active learning community in a great college town. With nearly 100 percent of students living on campus for all four years, they are often team members, volunteers, and student government participants. Our students have opportunities to study abroad and to engage in practical internships and research projects.  Our four-year graduation rate is well above the national average.
