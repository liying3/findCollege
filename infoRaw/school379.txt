What the School Says...
The University of Michigan is one of the great public research universities of the United States, located in vibrant Ann Arbor. U-M is distinguished by its unique alchemy of academic prestige, rich history and traditions, public ethos, and vibrant setting. Since 1817, U-M has been a global model of a diverse and comprehensive academic institution. It is recognized as one of the top 20 universities in the world, and one of the top public universities in the U.S. Students from all 50 states and 120 countries are mentored by some of the world's most influential faculty and join a community of more than 500,000 living alumni. Nineteen schools and colleges offer intellectual rigor in a cross-disciplinary environment encouraging inquiry in the classroom, undergraduate research, and broad opportunity. 


What the School Says...

We seek applicants who have challenged themselves with academic rigor in the subject areas where they do their best work, are accomplished in extracurricular endeavors, and are broadly diverse. Students may apply by the Nov. 1 Early Action deadline, and receive a decision (admit, defer, deny) by Dec. 24. The regular decision deadline is Feb. 1, with a decision (admit, waitlist, deny) by mid-April. (Note that the School of Music, Theatre & Dance deadline is Dec. 1.) We require either the SAT Reasoning Test or the ACT with writing, with no limit to the number of times that a student may take the tests. We will use the highest score from any one sitting of either test when reviewing the application.



What the School Says...
We awarded more than $309 million in financial aid in 2010-11 to 70 percent of U-M students. Most aid is based on demonstrated financial need; however, some is solely on merit. Financial aid is often awarded from a combination of grants, scholarships, loans and work-study employment. U-M uses information from the FAFSA and the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to determine eligibility for aid programs. Increasing aid from the university means most students pay less today than they would have in 2004.

Michigan students are challenged and invigorated by professors who are leaders in their fields, fellow students who are researchers and entrepreneurs, and experiences that change the way they see the world. Our academic vigor offers excellence across the disciplines and around the globe. Michigan offers 250 degree programs. Students can be an engineer and a historian, a mathematician and a pianist, or a nurse and an artist.  They realize their potential with academic support where they need it in our Sweetland Writing Center, academic advising, Comprehensive Studies Program, Sophomore Initiative, and more.  


What the School Says...
Bring thousands of brilliant, motivated, curious students together and they get inspired and challenged. They develop and discover their passions through more than 1,400 student organizations, like the seven-time national championship Solar Car Team comprised of 100 students across the disciplines. Students compete at the highest levels in Big Ten athletics, or cheer on the team. They engage in environmental activism, do a little dancing, debate philosophy, join a Michigan Learning Community, or take in natural beauty on the Huron River or the Nichols Arboretum. In Ann Arbor, one of America's most bike-friendly and sustainable communities and ranked as the #1 college town by Forbes in 2010, students thrive on the vibe, with art and culture everywhere.


What the School Says...
Broadly diverse and intellectually curious, Michigan students are leaders who make a difference. The fall 2012 freshman class averaged a 3.83 GPA in high school, with 20 percent earning a perfect 4.0. Thirty-four percent had an ACT composite score between 31 and 36, an impressive achievement by only four percent of students nationwide. Many have volunteered or participated in community service, worked at a family business or an after-school job, or participated in music, choral, or dance programs, club activities, tutoring or mentoring, fundraising or environmental efforts, student government, and more. Ninety-six percent of freshmen return for the sophomore year. About ninety percent of students graduate in five years.
