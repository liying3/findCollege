What the School Says...
The University of Houston is a Tier One research university, as designated by the Carnegie Foundation. We're on a mission to educate tomorrow's leaders in a learning environment that offers more than 40,000 students excellence in the classroom and hands-on leadership development in the community, across the nation, and around the globe. Named one of the best colleges in the nation for undergraduates by The Princeton Review, the University of Houston is also the second most ethnically diverse institution in the nation, with students from more than 120 countries.

What the School Says...
All freshmen applicants should submit a completed Apply Texas Application, official high school transcripts, and SAT or ACT scores. For students whose application file is complete by the December 1 priority deadline, automatic admission will be given to students in the top 10 percent of their graduating class, to students in the top 11-25 percent of their class with a minimum SAT score of 1000 (critical reading and math) or ACT composite of 21, and to students in the top 25-50 percent of their class with a minimum SAT of 1100 or ACT of 24. After December 1, all students that are not in the top 10 percent of their graduating class will be individually reviewed. Factors considered in the individual review process include: first-generation college attendance, extent and rigor of high school curriculum, socioeconomic background, awards earned, leadership and extracurricular activities, public service, and family responsibilities. The final application deadline for freshmen applicants is April 1.  For more information, visit www.uh.edu/admissions.




What the School Says...
Ranked as one of the nation's "Best Value" universities by The Princeton Review and recognized for graduating students with low amounts of debt, the University of Houston believes that everyone deserves the opportunity to pursue an education. UH offers a wide array of financial aid packages such as grants, loans, and work-study programs to help students invest in their future. If seeking financial aid, file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and list the University of Houston as a recipient (school code 003652). Funds are limited, and the financial aid process can take up to six weeks, so students should submit the FAFSA as soon as possible after January 1 of each year. For more information visit our financial aid website at www.uh.edu/financial.
