What the School Says...
With 12,000 undergraduates, University of North Carolina Wilmington provides a dynamic academic environment for tomorrow's leaders. UNCW is a public university that takes a private approach to education through research, study abroad opportunities, small class size, interaction with top-notch faculty, and an outstanding student satisfaction rate. UNCW offers 53 undergraduate majors with such standouts as Marine Biology, Creative Writing, Film Studies, Business, Psychology, Education, and Health and Human Services.  


What the School Says...
UNCW is selective and seeks students who have challenged themselves in rigorous high school programs. The deadline for early action (non-binding) is November 1, and decisions will be mailed on or around January 20. The deadline for regular decision is February 1, and decisions will be mailed on or around April 1. Financial Aid applications should be sent by March 1, and eligible students will be awarded for aid beginning March 15. UNCW superscores both the SAT and ACT with Writing. The Writing scores are considered separately.  


What the School Says...
UNCW's total cost of attendance makes it among the most affordable of the nation's top public universities. Students are encouraged to file for financial aid early in the year.  Parents should complete their IRS Tax forms, wait two weeks, and complete the FAFSA using the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. Some aid is awarded based on early filing due to limited funding. Taking more than 12 hours a semester makes financial sense as tuition charges max out at 12 hours. Taking 15 or 18 hours can reduce time to graduation and save thousands of dollars over the course of four years.  Refunds due to financial aid are available on the first day of class each semester.


What the School Says...
All classes are taught by professors, 86 percent of whom have earned a Ph.D. or the highest degree in their field.  Students commonly take advantage of UNC Wilmington's many opportunities to engage in high-level, faculty-sponsored research.  Students begin their academic studies in the College of Arts and Sciences. Here, applied learning, in which students gain hands-on experience with the skills of their major fields, is a hallmark of the student experience.  Applied learning is a key feature that makes us distinctive. Our faculty also sets us apart. 


What the School Says...
UNCW offers 8 residence halls, 13 on-campus university apartment buildings, 7 on-campus university suite buildings, and 13 brand new, modern apartment buildings that are reserved for upperclassmen only. All locations are air-conditioned and include laundry facilities, Internet, cable TV, voicemail, and a phone connection. Housing is guaranteed provided students meet established deadlines.


What the School Says...
UNCW students strive for academic excellence and work to make a difference in their communities through leadership and service, both during their time at UNCW and after graduation. UNCW students appreciate diversity of all kinds as an education benefit that enhances the academic experience.  Fostering the free exchange of ideas from multiple perspectives is the very foundation of higher education. Approximately 2,000 of our students come from 42 states and our international student population continues to grow, representing 62 countries last year.
