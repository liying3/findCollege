What the School Says...
Santa Clara University, a comprehensive Jesuit, Catholic university located 40 miles south of San Francisco in California's Silicon Valley, offers its more than 8,800 students rigorous undergraduate curricula in arts and sciences, business, theology, and engineering, plus master's, and law degrees  and engineering Ph.Ds.  Distinguished nationally by one of the highest graduation rates among all U.S. master's universities, California's oldest operating higher-education institution demonstrates faith-inspired values of ethics and social justice.


What the School Says...
Admission to SCU is competitive, and applicants undergo a comprehensive and holistic application evaluation that considers academic achievement, accomplishments outside of the classroom, and the potential for advancing the University's mission. When we review your application we will consider several elements: the overall quality and rigor of your high school courses (ninth-12th grade), academic performance and grades, results of standardized testing, letters of recommendation, extracurricular involvement, and leadership experience. 


What the School Says...
Our financial aid packages can substantially decrease the cost of attendance. Eighty-one percent of our students receive some form of aid from scholarships, grants, loans, and campus employment. When compared to some public universities having an average time to graduation of 5-plus years, Santa Clara may actually be a more cost-effective education. The intrinsic value of a Santa Clara education goes beyond the initial investment in tuition and related costs. Santa Clara graduates make immediate, measurable contributions as they enter or advance in their professions, and are sought by business, industry, nonprofits, and government.


What the School Says...
With a Jesuit education, you'll learn to think critically, understand the needs of the world, and act for the good of society. You'll be challenged to experience life beyond the classroom and become a contributing member of the global community. At SCU, you will enjoy an inspiring academic environment and will have the opportunity to draw upon many tools for learning, including a state-of-the-art library and learning commons, and 21st-century classrooms. Through immersion trips, academic exchanges, and outreach programs, our students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends gain perspective and enhance scholarship around the world.  Our faculty members are award-winning scientists, economists, theologians, artists, and writers who share their insights and expertise from their own real-world experience. A commitment to students and small classes enable the research experience and one-on-one access you need to succeed. 


What the School Says...
Day-to-day life for Santa Clara students is more than classes and homework. The university offers numerous activities for you to explore.  The campus features 12 student residences, extensive athletic facilities, a recreation and fitness center, a thriving performing arts facility, and an accredited museum of art and history. If you are a sports fan, we field 19 Division I athletic teams and are known for our successful soccer and volleyball programs. The Ruff Riders, the official student booster club of SCU athletics, is the largest of more than 100 student organizations on campus. Plus, we are 30 minutes from coastal beaches and less than an hour from San Francisco. Yosemite and Lake Tahoe are within four hours of campus.


What the School Says...
Santa Clara embraces the notion that we must be global educators, researchers, students, citizens, and partners. The University is committed to creating an enriching learning community with students, faculty, and staff of diverse backgrounds, respectful of difference, and enlivened by open dialogue. And wherever Santa Clara graduates find themselves after graduation, they are able to apply their education and skills to build a career, improve their workplace, and strengthen their community. Surveys consistently show that our graduates perform well whether they accept a full-time job, attend a graduate school program, or decide to participate in a service program such as the Jesuit Volunteer Corps.
