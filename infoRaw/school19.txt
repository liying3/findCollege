What the School Says...
 Anselmans live for a challenge,  listen with their hearts, and lead with their minds. They  welcome different views, stand up for their beliefs, and love a good debate. Ninety percent are involved in campus clubs and athletics. To an Anselman, doing something worthwhile always trumps doing something easy. That's why many students prefer to spend their winter and spring breaks helping others through service missions to inner-city neighborhoods, hurricane-stricken coasts, or Native American reservations. The Center for Experiential Learning collaborates with faculty, alumni, and business partners to provide innovative learning opportunities, such as internships and study abroad, that also address societal interests and needs. In addition, the Center offers a wide range of resources to support students throughout their college experience, including advising services that help students choose the right major or minor, prepare for graduate school, find career opportunities, and prepare for life after college.
