What the School Says...
Founded in 1857, Sewanee: The University of the South is a small, private, national liberal arts and science college affiliated with the Episcopal Church. Located on a gorgeous 13,000-acre campus atop the Cumberland Plateau in Sewanee, Tenn., Sewanee is a unique academic community rich in traditions. Some 1,500 students hailing from 43 states and 23 countries pursue Sewanee's 36 majors and 32 minors in the academic tradition that has produced 26 Rhodes Scholars. Town and gown are one and the same at Sewanee. The University's vice chancellor and president also serves as mayor of the on-campus town of Sewanee, which is home to 2,300 full-time community members, including 90 percent of the school's renowned faculty.


What the School Says...
The Sewanee admissions process is highly competitive, and those selected are chosen for their ability to perform in a challenging academic environment. Sewanee offers four admission plans: Early Decision I (Nov. 15), Early Action (Dec. 1), Early Decision II (Jan. 15), Regular Decision (Feb. 1). Early Decision plans are binding; Early Action and Regular Decision plans are non-binding. Sewanee requires either the SAT, ACT, or test-optional materials (an evaluative phone interview and a graded writing sample). All applications must be completed using the Common Application. Some credit is given for AP and IB examinations.


What the School Says...
Sewanee understands that an investment in private higher education is a substantial one for most families. Support from alumni and the University's endowment enables the institution to provide students with scholarships, loans, and other financial aid programs in an attempt to make Sewanee as accessible and affordable as possible. In 2011, Sewanee cut tuition, room, and board by 10 percent. Students matriculating in 2012 enjoy a four-year guaranteed cost of tuition, room, and board. Admission to Sewanee is need-blind for domestic students and need-aware for international students.


What the School Says...
A Sewanee education takes the long view. Beyond the particulars of academic disciplines, it improves each student's ability to adapt to a changing world and develops intellectual capacities. It prepares students for continued learning, not as passive recipients of knowledge but as critical thinkers who can question, analyze, and communicate wherever life's path may lead. Sewanee's curriculum supports this academic mission in every way. From broad general education requirements to specialized research opportunities, from small seminar discussions to close advising, each aspect of the academic program aims to increase each student's level of engagement, learning, and achievement. The curriculum is divided into three components: general education courses, which establish fundamental competencies and knowledge; the major, which is usually declared at the end of sophomore year and constitutes about a third of each student's course load; and electives, which students can select to complement a major or to explore new academic territory. In concert, these components shape an education of balance and rigor.


What the School Says...
Sewanee's 13,000-acre campus, known as the Domain, is an outdoor classroom, an unmatched place for contemplation, and an excellent vantage point from which all Sewanee students can study the world. As a home, a community, a playground, and a place to treasure and protect, the Domain keeps students engaged and actively learning in every aspect of life. Hardy intellectualism is balanced by healthy social and community engagement. Sewanee boasts more than 100 student-run clubs and organizations. With vibrant Greek life and NCAA Division III athletics, an active outing club, a well-funded program board, and numerous community outreach programs, Sewanee students do not have to look far for fun, and 90 percent of them stay on campus on the weekends.


What the School Says...
Sewanee students learn and live collaboratively, challenging and growing with one another. Through classes, community engagement, study abroad, and internships, Sewanee students hone their skills and develop global perspectives. The idea of honor pervades the student experience. All students become part of a 100-year-old honor system by pledging not to lie, cheat, or steal. Sewanee aspires to produce students of intellectual achievement, real-world ability, and integrity.
