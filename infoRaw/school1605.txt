What the School Says...
The University of North Florida has a growing reputation for academic excellence. Perhaps this is why UNF was recently named among the best institutions in the Southeast by The Princeton Review and U.S. News & World Report, and listed as a "Top 20 Best Value College" by Forbes magazine. With a student body of about 16,000, students can receive all the personalized attention of a small college while also gaining the opportunities available at larger universities. Our location in the city of Jacksonville affords students the resources to obtain relevant life experiences outside the classroom setting.


What the School Says...
The priority deadline for incoming freshman applications is in mid-November each year with decisions released by mid-December. All other applications will be reviewed on a space-available basis. Transfer deadlines change frequently, so students who wish to transfer to UNF are encouraged to check the admissions website for the most current information. Applicants must submit test scores from either the SAT or ACT to be considered for admission. Students are encouraged to submit multiple scores because the admissions office evaluates applications based on composite scores, not individual test sittings. 


What the School Says...
UNF is part of Florida's public state university system, which means tuition rates are low, especially for Florida residents. Applicants who demonstrate high academic achievement or financial need may apply to receive one of several scholarships. During the past academic year, UNF offered more than $8 million in institutional scholarships, including academic merit-based and financial need-based awards. To qualify for the most financial aid, students are advised to fill out the FAFSA early. 


What the School Says...
UNF offers 58 undergraduate majors and more than 73 areas of concentration. Among these are six flagship programs that have been designated in fields where the University is uniquely qualified to provide regional or national leadership: Coastal Biology, Community Nursing, International Business, Music, Nutrition and Dietetics, and Transportation and Logistics. Our Jazz Studies program is also internationally known as one of the best in the nation.


What the School Says...
Living on campus is the best way to experience life at UNF. There are six residence halls including a new complex, Osprey Fountains, which has its own fitness center and swimming pool. UNF students stay busy outside the classroom by staying actively involved on campus. There are over 150 clubs and organizations offering activities from Greek life and student government to premed and surfing.


What the School Says...
UNF is known for providing students with Transformational Learning Opportunities, or TLOs as they are known on campus.  Each of our students has a chance to take part in a life-changing experience, such as conducting research with faculty, participating in community-based learning, or studying abroad, which UNF students do at twice the national average.
