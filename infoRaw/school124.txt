What the School Says...
Susquehanna University educates enterprising, independent thinkers. No matter their major or career plans, our students graduate with the broad-based academic foundation and 21st-century job skills (critical thinking, writing, teamwork, and communication skills) that employers and graduate schools seek. A selective, residential, four-year college in Selinsgrove, Pa., Susquehanna educates students in the liberal arts and sciences and provides them with real-world, professional experiences. The university is recognized nationally for its commitment to off-campus study and building students' cultural competency through the Global Opportunities program. Just two-and-a-half hours from Philadelphia and Baltimore, three hours from Washington, D.C., and New York City, and one hour from the state capital of Harrisburg, students  have many opportunities to network with alumni, pursue internships, and explore professional opportunities.



What the School Says...
Susquehanna students come to us from many different places and varied backgrounds. But they share a motivation to succeed and a record of academic and personal achievement. They are ready to be academically challenged, socially engaged, and mentally prepared to succeed in the 21st century. We accept either the Susquehanna Application or Common Application, along with an official high school transcript, school report, and SAT/ACT scores (or a graded writing sample under our Test Score Optional plan). We offer Early Decision and Early Action options. Admission is competitive, but we evaluate (and value) more than grades and test scores.



What the School Says...
We are committed to making college affordable for our students and their families. More than 95 percent of students receive some form of financial support. All admitted students are considered for academic merit scholarships. To determine a scholarship award, our admission committee will review your courses, grades, test scores, and class rank, if calculated. Academic scholarships are renewable for a total of four years, and renewal criteria are reasonable. Many families who think they won't qualify for need-based financial aid do qualify at Susquehanna. Complete a FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) to ensure you are considered for all the resources for which you are eligible.



What the School Says...
With 60 majors and minors, students easily combine their talents and interests with their career aspirations. Susquehanna faculty members are dedicated scholars and passionate teachers. Full-time professors, not graduate students, teach all courses. Class sizes average 19 students, so you'll get to know your professors and they'll get to know you in a highly personalized academic environment. Many disciplines offer hands-on, collaborative research opportunities beginning in the first year of study. In the sciences, these include a wide range of field research projects in the nearby Susquehanna River. The Sigmund Weis School of Business is one of the few undergraduate business programs worldwide to earn AACSB accreditation, and our nationally recognized Global Opportunities Program prepares students for the global marketplace.



What the School Says...
It's easy to get involved here. We have 145 student-run clubs and organizations, including fraternities, sororities, and service groups. There are plenty of leadership opportunities, too. Students enjoy cheering on our 23 NCAA Division III intercollegiate teams and participating in intramural and club sports. Favorite Susquehanna traditions, such as Orange & Maroon Day and the annual Thanksgiving dinner served by faculty, unite the student body. We guarantee four years of exceptional campus housing in traditional residence halls, suites, and townhouses. Popular nightlife spots on campus include Charlie's Coffeehouse and our campus nightclub TRAX, which features dance parties and live bands. Students also run, hike, kayak, go tubing on the river, and otherwise enjoy our natural surroundings.



What the School Says...
Susquehanna students come from more than 30 states and 20 countries, bringing diverse perspectives to the campus community. Students here lead busy lives. In addition to their academic schedule and responsibilities, most get involved in several campus organizations. The Career Development Center develops a four-year plan for students so they start thinking early about their career options. The great majority of students complete at least one internship or professional experience, graduate in four years, and are employed or in professional or graduate school within six months of receiving their degree. In 2013 and 2014, eight students received prestigious Fulbright scholarships to study or do research overseas.
