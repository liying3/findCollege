What the School Says...
A Barnard College education provides women with tools to think critically and act effectively in today's world. It fosters a respect for learning, an aptitude for analysis, and a competence in the demanding disciplines of the liberal arts and sciences. By virtue of the College's mission and location, a Barnard education encourages women to strengthen their insight and forge ahead with their ideas, well-prepared and unafraid. Barnard women do not develop in a vacuum of isolation, since they practice what they learn in a co-ed and global environment on a daily basis. Located on the West Side of Manhattan, across from Columbia University, Barnard's neighborhood is one of the city's most diverse. Students enjoy the comfort of a green campus oasis with the spirit of a vibrant city. 


What the School Says...
The Committee on Admissions selects young women of proven academic strength who exhibit intellectual voracity and strong potential for further scholarly growth. In addition to school records (including a rigorous curriculum and strong grades), recommendations, writing, and test scores, the candidates' talents, abilities, interests, and personal history are given careful consideration.  While admission is highly selective, it is also holistic; no one criterion or score determines acceptance. Each applicant is considered in terms of her personal qualities, her intellectual capacity, and the rigor of the curriculum she has pursued, as well as her curiosity, drive, and potential for achieving at Barnard. And, each applicant is reviewed in the context of her school, community, and individual story.


What the School Says...
Barnard's financial aid process is designed to foster quality, access, and diversity, as outlined by our institutional mission. As such, our policies are committed to making Barnard a realistic option, regardless of finances, and to ensuring qualified applicants will not be denied a Barnard education because they cannot afford it. To the extent possible, the Office of Financial Aid assists each family using grants, loans, and job opportunities to meet 100 percent of demonstrated need, and provides advice on financing a Barnard education. All Barnard aid is based on financial need. While every family's income and assets are evaluated uniformly to determine family contribution, special and individual circumstances are also taken into consideration. We welcome communication from families to help each make the best financial choices.


What the School Says...
As leading scholars and innovators in their fields, Barnard faculty members make headlines and have bylines in the media and prominent journals. But foremost, they are teachers. And mentoring students is one of the most gratifying parts of their work. Barnard's low student-faculty ratio gives faculty the time to challenge students to think about concepts and connection to the world around them in new ways.  Discussions are engaging and challenging in Barnard classes. Whether in lectures or seminar-style courses, students question, debate, and draw on ideas and connections from life experiences and other coursework. Insatiable curiosity makes Barnard students incisive critical thinkers, effective problem solvers, and creative individuals trained to follow their curiosity, question ambiguity, and broaden their thinking.


What the School Says...
Our adventurous students relax amid a close-knit community, while events strike a balance between city and campus. Barnard's location provides an oasis from the sometimes frenetic energy of a city that never sleeps. More than 90 percent of students live in one of 12 residence halls and have access to more than 80 clubs and organizations. Add to this list hundreds of dually recognized clubs Barnard women join and lead at Columbia, provided for through our longstanding partnership. Student groups include performance and service, academic and pre-professional, ethnic and cultural, 16 Division I varsity sports, club and intermural sports, and numerous publications. Groups sponsor lectures, concerts, recitals, and panels. Community events such as Midnight Breakfast, Spirit Day, and Founder's Day are annual traditions. All with easy access to all that New York City offers.


What the School Says...
Barnard is a diverse community of intellectual discovery where scholarship thrives, women shape their experiences, and boldness is encouraged. Barnard graduates overwhelmingly describe their college experience as transformative, inspiring, and empowering. New York City is a laboratory where students apply classroom theory. Theater majors head to Broadway and art historians to world-class museums. Our location also means practical learning with 2,500 internships in law, medicine, finance, publishing, journalism, and politics. Our alumnae light up every field and live with passion and purpose.
