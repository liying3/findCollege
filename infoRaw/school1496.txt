What the School Says...
Admission to the freshman class is competitive. We encourage all students to apply early. Admission decisions are made on a rolling basis. A decision is generally rendered within six to eight weeks after the file is complete. Students who have completed their junior year of high school may be considered for Early Admission. If accepted for Early Admission, the student would enter FAU as a freshman instead of attending high school for their senior year. Please be aware that meeting minimum eligibility requirements does not guarantee admission as each applicant's academic profile will be weighed against the applicant pool in its entirety. This includes high school GPA, rigor of curriculum, and test scores.


What the School Says...
Financial Aid is available to FAU degree-seeking students and includes grants, loans, scholarships, and employment opportunities.

Additionally, the Financial Aid staff can assist students with questions regarding all aid and scholarship programs.
