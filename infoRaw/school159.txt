What the School Says...
Founded in 1876, the United States Coast Guard Academy has a proud tradition as one of the finest colleges in the country and is currently ranked among the best baccalaureate colleges in the region. Core values of honor, respect, and devotion to duty provide the bedrock for the Academy's goals: to develop leaders of character, groom fleet-ready ensigns, and create lifelong learners. Cadets build lasting friendships, study with inspiring teachers in small classes, and train aboard America's Tall Ship EAGLE and on the most sophisticated ships and aircraft available. The USCGA offers 23 varsity sports and 12 fields of study. Our 110-acre waterfront campus is located in New London, Conn, 45 miles southeast of Hartford.


What the School Says...
Unlike the other service academies, a congressional nomination is not required to apply for admission. Admission is based on a holistic review of all completed applications received. To be considered for admission to the Coast Guard Academy, you must submit all application materials by February 1 of the year of entrance. An early action decision is also available for those who want to apply earlier. The Coast Guard Academy's ranking among the nation's elite undergraduate colleges is reflected in our highly selective admission process. We identify the best candidates from a pool of approximately 5,000 applicants to obtain a class size of less than 300 new cadets. Those accepted demonstrate proven academic accomplishment, particularly in math and the sciences, skill as an athlete, a record of service to the community, motivation to embrace leadership development, and an unwavering desire to serve their country and humanity.


What the School Says...
Like the other U.S. federal service academies, our U.S. students receive a full scholarship. There is no charge for tuition, room, or board. In addition, cadets receive approximately $900 per month for books, uniforms, and personal expenses. Graduates are guaranteed positions of leadership following gradation, serving as officers in the U.S. Coast Guard. A five-year service obligation is required following graduation. Most cadets enjoy the experience so much that four out of five voluntarily choose to remain in the Coast Guard after their initial commitment.  


What the School Says...
The Coast Guard Academy offers a four-year experience filled with exciting challenges that foster the intellectual, physical, and professional growth of our future Coast Guard leadership. With a student-to-faculty ratio of approximately 8 to 1, our mantra is to develop a professional relationship with each and every cadet that supports their development and unlocks their potential. We provide a four-year Bachelor of Science degree program, with the curriculum heavily oriented toward math, science, and engineering. Majors include: Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Naval Architecture/Marine Engineering, Operations Research/Computer Analysis, Marine and Environmental Sciences, Management, and Government.


What the School Says...
Given the intensity of Academy life, most cadets are eager for the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities. Fortunately, social events and organized activities are an integral part of the cadet experience. Ranging from informal organizations to long-standing traditions, these activities and clubs are part of the social experience that bonds cadets to one another and to their service. Activities are supported by the Academy and new groups form whenever cadets take the initiative to organize them. Academy cadets compete at the Division III level in one of 23 varsity sports. All cadets are expected to participate in either a varsity or intramural sport each year. Teamwork, camaraderie, and competition are keys to success in the Coast Guard, and there's no better way to develop these attributes than on the playing field.


What the School Says...
Whether it is the quality of academic programming, leadership development, or rigorous professional training, the Coast Guard Academy has been recognized as among the best colleges in the nation by organizations such as U.S. News and World Report, Princeton Review, and Forbes. Most Academy graduates choose to continue their education in some of the nation's top graduate and law schools. Coast Guard leadership experience and a prestigious graduate school degree is the right combination for success in civilian careers. Academy graduates have assumed key roles in government, started their own businesses, and have accepted positions in our nation's top corporations, law firms, and universities.
